Hodl, diamond hands apes. But here‚Äôs the thing. The squeeze is over. This is why:\n\n* WSB is tired of GME.\n\nThis is no longer a hype train on a collision course with the moon. Normal people are starting to get bored of it. And that means GME doesn‚Äôt have the hype-oriented buying power to outscale the significant downward pressure on this stock\n\n* The squeeze was never going to happen.\n\nYou know what FTDs are? Of course you do, you‚Äôve read the DD. They always end on some variation of ‚Äòthose failure to delivers will have to be paid off eventually, and then it‚Äôll be TO THE MOON!‚Äô. What they leave out is that they don‚Äôt really. Sure, they will be paid off eventually. But not today, and not this week. They‚Äôll be paid off slowly during dips, or they‚Äôll wait until the stock craters months from now, or just drag it out until gamestop goes under and then never have to deliver at all. \n\n‚ÄúBut that‚Äôs illegal‚Äù you say. Yes, and so what. The market makers don‚Äôt play by the rules. Even if the FTC cares (which it doesn‚Äôt) and hits them with a fine, it‚Äôll most likely be a slap on the wrist. They‚Äôre choosing between bankruptcy on one hand vs a lawsuit they expect to settle on the other. They will not deliver. The squeeze will not squoze.\n\n* Hodlers *never* gonna hodl\n\nIgnoring all that, maybe there was a chance. Sure, those FTDs would be kicked down the road indefinitely. Until they couldn‚Äôt any more. Maybe that takes years, but if all the float was locked down for all that time, and the FTC finally paid attention... sure. Maybe. Because that‚Äôs not accounting for the human element. WSB grew because of greed for a quick payout. And y‚Äôall have done magnificently, overall, hanging on against your immediate interests with the promise of a payout in the future. But the fact is, most people got out when they were green. Even more got out when they were red. Reddit shows you popular posts, and WSB‚Äôs most popular posts will be those doubling down and holding on... but that‚Äôs not representative of what people are *actually* doing. You can look at the stats from the DDs to see that volume is down; they‚Äôll claim that‚Äôs a good thing. It‚Äôs not. GME was only ever going to work when *everyone* was buying in. When it‚Äôs stagnant, it‚Äôs going to slowly sliiide away. And then those edge investors are going to go. And then it really will tumble.\n\n* Delusion\n\nY‚Äôall were hype for an earnings report. Fucking why. **Nothing** about GME the stock had to do with the fundamentals of the company itself. By being excited to see if their corporate performance would *magically* improve just because the stock did just gave away how many people joined in the cult thinking, somehow, that gamestop was actually an unappreciated gem of a company. It‚Äôs not, and it never will be. They are and always have been a grocery store of video games; and grocery stores have *very* narrow margins. And grocery stores *have* to exist for society to survive. Gamestop does not.\n\n* Gamestop screwed themselves\n\nYou know what, though, that report gave away a final critical nail in the GME hype train. Because in it, they announced they would be *adding stocks to the market*. Why? To pay off their debts, by selling to you rubes who think it‚Äôs a good investment.\n\nGuess what adding stocks does to your precious squeeze? You may have held all the float before.. now there‚Äôs more float being printed. Good luck keeping up with it; even if you do, they‚Äôll keep on adding until they‚Äôre above water, or the stock price collapses. The squeeze is over, because even if you held all their stocks in a pretty little squeezable bag... they just made more. And now those FTDs can be delivered through the side door, with fresh, unbagged stocks.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIt was a good run. And *maybe* a good plan. But the other guys cheated, your own team ran out of steam, and the guys you were playing for sold the match while you were out there playing it. \n\nI‚Äôm sorry you had to find out this way; but for the love of god, get out *before* your life savings are zeroed. You played, you lost, now *live to try again.*\n\nGG WP, and I‚Äôll see y‚Äôall in the sequel.\n\nNot financial advice.","created_utc":"2021-03-24 17:29:30","num_comments":27,"score":0,"upvote_ratio":0.41,"is_original_content":false,"permalink":"/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mch7hn/gme_is_bagged/","title":"GME is Bagged","author":"Quintuplin","firstseen":"2021-03-24 21:38:37.018745"}

First of all, if you sold today, you're a paper handed bitch. No way around it, that's the truth. If you didn't sell today, you're a diamond hand ape, and my condolences for your loss. \n\nNow that we all know our place in the world, let's do some fucking poor man's math. Q4 earnings came out yesterday and it seems that they weren't very good, right? Wrong. \n\nI'm gonna zero in on EPS in this post. There was $1.23 in basic EPS for Q4. Compare this to Jan 2020 which was $0.32 EPS. So earnings per share compared to same period prior year is up 384%. That's insanely good. \n\nNow, let's talk about what this could mean for share price based on the fun-duh-mentals. Assuming this EPS can be maintained going forward, which arguably I think is low. (They already disclosed February sales are bonkers.) So again, assuming a quarterly EPS of $1.23, that's $4.92 annual EPS. At 20x p/e we are looking at a share price of $98.40. At a 30x p/e we are looking at a share price of $147.60. \n\nThis says to me that we are currently trading in the value territory right now. Irrespective of a squeeze, this isn't a half bad gamble on the pivot. People saying \"back to $12\" are either retarded (the bad kind), trolling, or bots. There is no mathematical way it could reach $12. Assets minus liabilities right now is literally $6/share. \n\n\nHere are a couple more thoughts floating around. \n\nI think we all expected the holiday sales to be a bit better. However, around Christmas only the true autists were on board here. So all this free publicity hasn't factored in to holiday sales at all. I think this free publicity has pushed GME to the front of everyone's mind and there can be some major tailwinds as a result going forward. Also, see the EPS results for same period prior year - holiday sales were way up.\n\nShouldn't new console cycle have helped more? Obviously yes, problem is no one could get them. There has been a huge chip shortage so consoles have been a hot commodity and remain a hot commodity (once they stock more that is). Also, margins on console sales are shit. It's all the peripherals that help the bottom line. The new console cycle will continue driving future growth. \n\nA good portion of this year they have been crippled by the pandemic. Coming out of the pandemic, foot traffic will pick up again. Even if this isn't a significant focus for the new board, it still keeps the lights on. \n\nLet's also highlight that RC and team have not made any *significant* changes to the company other than coming up with concepts and ideas. This is a huge ship that takes ages to turn, it isn't going to pivot overnight. Almost none of their ideas are reflected in yesterday's earnings report. \n\n\nIf you guys have more thoughts or criticisms, I would love to hear where all you autistic apes are at after this bloodbath today.","created_utc":"2021-03-24 17:00:53","num_comments":21,"score":34,"upvote_ratio":0.87,"is_original_content":false,"permalink":"/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mcgj8r/napkin_math_on_the_short_bus_window/","title":"Napkin math on the short bus window","author":"Im_A_Canadian_Eh","firstseen":"2021-03-24 21:38:37.033526"}

Here's what Wall St. sees: A company that has been around clinging to life for 34 years, they never had a financial success to truly call their own.\n\n until now...\n\nThey have a new drug on the market is the US (coming to Japan soon and is slated for EU approvals this year as well) and it's their 3rd one! Yep that's right, they've been clinging on for years off of 2 that never were quite what it took to generate the revenue/earnings they needed to break their chains of small cap status but now they have what it takes... you might as so Fin WHAT.... what's the difference....  **they own it, entirely; patents, they accumulated a sales force, and have sales rights globally.** \n\nWhy this matters: The first drug they were hard up for $ and ended up taking royalty agreements on to keep the company operating, because they had faith in their pipeline of other drugs but needed to keep the lights on, the 2nd a government contract for an anti viral against influenza, they got lucky on this during the H1N1 pandemic as it garnered a few government contracts to stockpile ( but this never was fully fleshed out to the point of generating demand within the healthcare system and consequently > revenue/earnings <- what Wall St. wants to see! ( I believe the CEO and company are well aware of this long standing shortfall and may be seeking ways to address it! The government is still stockpiling it, as it's useful to the military especially incase of outbreaks in a foreign environment but the drug needs to be used to be profitable, not just stockpiled, and it's possible they may seek expansion into hospital use!\n\nDrug #3!!!  They have done all the work and spent nearly 1.5 billion to achieve this upcoming success oriented path, and most people will never hear about it (especially early on like now)... **But here I am and you will know about BCRX because of this.**\n\nWhy it's different... I know I know, we hear it all the time, it's different and usually it turns out.... it's not... but this time; it actually is!  \n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nThe company announced they are aiming to 10x their previous yearly revenue and the Orladeyo drug launch should easily turn the company into profitable ( **by my estimation; capture of \\~8% of the HAE market (US UK JP) will turn the company profitable for the first time in possibly a decade... but they're aiming for 30%-50%!** )  This isn't to say, GET IN NOW OR YOU LOSE.  It's actually the opposite.. Take a look @ this company for yourself, make an informed decision and take grasp of those shares firmly for the long term ride if you believe in the company like I do.\n\nThe company has garnered **\\~1/2 takedas' HAE sales force (the rival company in this disease treatment space) <- this is a direct indication of what the competition knows this company can achieve (Sorry Cathie).**\n\nIn terms of quarterly # expectations (I could be really wrong here but here's what I think based upon my knowledge/precedent):  I suspect to see a weak Q1 sales figure; as costs will likely be very high in terms of marketing, production ramp up,  new hires, and delays in $ being paid out by insurance companies.  I believe Q2 revenue/earnings coming in (August) is where the possibility of a flip in costs/debts can begin.  This means the company will close the gap of expenses vs costs or possibly invert into profitability for the balance sheet.  **Sept are good calls here imo!**\n\nNo other company on the planet actually has what they created, a drug development platform which generates highly specific drug structures as crystals for oral administration of drugs instead of injections with the ability to target multiple rare and common diseases. \n\nTo make this clearer for the average investor**, every one of their current drugs in development has the possibility to be considered Name Brand!  That means it's first in it's class and has no known competition or generics able to steal from their success for their drugs (several years patent protection, at least, currently most of their drugs will garner \\~10-20 years of protection with possibility to extend this protection when near term end of those dates.)** \n\nThe company has done tons of research in rare disease treatment spaces, have been talking with Dr's and patients for 7 years about this now and the CEO is driven to help these people with the challenge they were facing (becoming a pincushion for their entire lives while living with a painful life threatening disease.)  \n\nMore important than those special things is where they are headed: The pipeline...  \n\n1. (Orladeyo just recently they got their Japan approval, which should go into patient hands there during Q2 if pricing is finalized in JP) EU approvals most likely will occur throughout Q2-3-4 this year (as it's approved by country vs all at once) \n2. Factor D inhibitor (which they just released excellent data on has the potential to serve rare unmet diseases/needs for multiple disease indications hence why it's called a pipeline in a molecule.  This is basically fast tracked into a Pase2/3 trial and has low financial cost to perform/complete as it will be performed as a pivotal trial.  I have read by a few people that they're concerned about the LDH levels in patients not being lowered (more) - truth be told, **I believe a remaining elevated LDH might be a very good sign and this will be contrarian to what most people see it as.**  Here's why I believe slightly elevated LDH can be considered a good sign... increases in LDH can indicate many a thing, but in a PNH patient it's extremely common to see high LDH levels as their body has adjusted towards favoring anaerobic metabolism pathways **to literally stay alive.**                                                                                        \nWhy this is important.... Increased blood cell size and prevalence is an extremely good sign (**they nearly got flawless results here approaching 100% in the vast majority of patients on Factor D**) Increased blood size does not mean a complete reversion to normal blood oxygen transfer capacity resulting in aerobic cellular respiration (the normal state) as seems to be be seen in patients which get a direct blood transfusion of perfectly healthy red blood cells.  This means the Factor D drug is in-fact helping these people in more than 1 way, not only is it halting the massive RBC losses but it's allowing a stabilization of their metabolic systems (energy levels and overall wellness) which could lead to further increases in recovery and possibly over a long term - lowered LDH levels.  If LDH levels decline over a long period this test could be used by healthcare providers as an easy way to verify 2 things > that Factor D is still helping the patient or if they are possibly faltering in their adherence to their medication schedule (2x daily).\n3. (FOP (a terrible bone growing disease which changes your tissues into bone) - no known treatments in the world) Factor D -> potentially able to disrupt 100 billion by modulating the **alternative complement system** within the body and lastly Galidesivir ( a hopeful broad spectrum anti viral.)\n4. Galidesivir - A broad spectrum anti-viral which will take, in my opinion, will take a lot of capital  to initiate and bring into a very competitive space (and should remain a small factor developmentally until they have more capital and means to produce bulk quantities of.)  Most people think covid-19 immediately here, but imo it's not a great idea to pursue it's use in that space and should instead try to focus on dose ranging as low as possible for severe infections in children/infants if they cannot produce bulk quantities efficiently/cheaply.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nAs I nearly always suggest: Do your own research ( [https://ir.biocryst.com/events](https://ir.biocryst.com/events) is a really good starting point, you can listen to what the company is trying to do and where they're headed and their social media shows you a glimpse of their focus and environment work culture/environment over at > [**https://twitter.com/BioCrystPharma**](https://twitter.com/BioCrystPharma)**.**)\n\nLastly are you willing to diamond hand because you actually believe in this company? or do you just want a get rich quick cause we need to kill shorts on it?! \n\nYes, there are shorts latched on this company; always has been (by their competitors and nay Sayers trying to spread FUD to keep this company's growth potential held down), but the loan fees as it stands are not going to kill them off like GME could so throw that \"kill the shorts\" hype out the window  here for now please! I have learned a lot about shorts as of late, and yes the shorts are mostly underwater on BCRX, but they currently have minimal risk of getting squeezed with the low borrow fee on this ticker.\n\nMaybe some of you guys will join this bandwagon with me and the other long term believers in this company which I know you are out there and possibly elevate this into special meme status and hype etc. but to be honest, I could care less... and it's likely why I utterly suck at generating that type of message, and is likely why I fail to garner attention to this company that I feel it deserves while being deeply undervalued and underpriced.  I am willing to wait years to see this grow into a big success over the long term (and possibly pay out a nice dividend once Factor D comes?) \n\nThis isn't my first WSB post on this company and it wont be my last, and yes I was trolled into oblivion when the company didn't YOLO it's resources into Galidesivir (but looking back, I'm grateful they didn't to a large degree... and it's possible they took actions based upon the messages they received from activist investors, such as myself (\\*wink wink nudge nudge WSB\\*  Also: thanks for listening to my messages Mr. CEO Stonehouse) \n\nI believe the company has management that align with what some activist investors want/expect and that's to transform this company into a fortress fighting the good fight against terrible and rare diseases to help people while being able to hold it's own in the playing field of other big pharma giants.\n\nTL;DR? I've got 50k on Sept calls and leaps at multiple strike prices!!! (I'm loaded up on shares as well) My target of Sept covers what I believe to be upcoming big sales vs the past in the upcoming Q1/Q2 #'s + JP authorizing finalizing sales approval + EU approvals on Orladeyo and the leaps are for what lay beyond in the pipeline+ increased sales!","created_utc":"2021-03-24 16:59:31","num_comments":2,"score":8,"upvote_ratio":0.79,"is_original_content":false,"permalink":"/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mcghx5/revival_of_a_company_wall_st_believed_to_be_a/","title":"Revival of a company Wall St. believed to be a zombie - Cathies' Takeda about to get burned? - BCRX investor and activist investor dreams becoming realized!","author":"DerpyMcOptions","firstseen":"2021-03-24 21:38:37.034434"}

They are moving towards supporting the democratized future of tech instead of the traditional closed universe that they and Microsoft promoted for decades.\n\nIn a sense this is a recognition by Intel of the death of Moore's law, just as Microsoft's embrace of Open Source was a recognition of the long term death of proprietary software. $INTC is a huge buy right now, especially with the overall NASDAQ drop having put it on sale.\n\n[https://www.theregister.com/2021/03/24/intel\\_gelsinger\\_strategy/](https://www.theregister.com/2021/03/24/intel_gelsinger_strategy/)","created_utc":"2021-03-24 16:55:24","num_comments":5,"score":14,"upvote_ratio":0.89,"is_original_content":false,"permalink":"/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mcgelc/intel_ceases_to_be_lone_wolf_invests_in_2_new_us/","title":"Intel ceases to be lone wolf, invests in 2 new US Fabs, will support RISC-V!","author":"Cluutch45","firstseen":"2021-03-24 21:38:37.035367"}

Nothing about the way he spoke showed any signs of leadership.\n\nRather than rise to the occasion, Sherman flubbed his way through the figures. This was, in all likelihood, the most attended earnings cal of all time! This man was presented with a golden opportunity to the ascend to the CEO pantheon of memestock gods. But rather than channeling his inner technoking, he choked, and fell back to Earth to ride out the remainder of his days as a withered husk on a üßªthrone.\n\nThe beating we took in the market today lands squarely on the narrow, weak shoulders of George Sherman. The earnings miss didn‚Äôt kill momentum. The visionless, energy sapping, humdrum monotony of his presentation did.\n\nBut this could be good. The team coming in is clearly Cohen‚Äôs. Sherman‚Äôs abject failure here gives good reason to oust this boomer as well.\n\nLastly, you üßªüôå bitches really going to bet against DFV a third time??!? If he‚Äôs holding, I‚Äôm holding. If he sells... then fuck it, I‚Äôll go to Valhalla by myself.","created_utc":"2021-03-24 16:21:07","num_comments":31,"score":91,"upvote_ratio":0.92,"is_original_content":false,"permalink":"/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mcfls1/why_the_earnings_fiasco_could_be_good_for_the/","title":"Why the earnings fiasco could be good for the future (fuck George Sherman)","author":"MJRChap","firstseen":"2021-03-24 21:38:37.050313"}

WONDERING IF ITS WORTH LOWERING MY AVERAGE OR IF IM GETTING IN OVER MT HEAD POST\n\nSo initially I bought into amc with the plan to sell for profit buy a single gme stock. Sell it for more and buy myself an Elgato Wave 3 mic with the profits made. This isn‚Äôt what‚Äôs happened so far\n\nMy new plan is to try to get back to break even on my initial $300 investment \n\nThere‚Äôs 2 ways \n\nHold my gme stock and sell at anything higher than 300 usd. As a Canadian I still make monies (I‚Äôm not diamond hands enough for this. Plus I don‚Äôt have the capital to make significant money)\n\nOption 2 is \n\nMy gme average is $270. I fucked up and bought way to high. At the current price ($120) I could drop my average to the range of $120 - $160 (depends on if I invest $500 -$3000). Within this price range anything at $180 or higher makes me money. At $3000 I would make a $400 profit (3000+initial 300). Which if I do this why wouldn‚Äôt I just buy the an Elgato wave 3 mic like I want to and then sell my gme stock to at least break even and call this a good market introduction\n\nBut there is the factor with option 2 let‚Äôs say I do $500 CAD which I most likely would. That‚Äôs like 3 gme stocks with my avg cost going to like $160. It gme jumps back up to the $300s I would make like $1200 CAD profit\n\nWhere I need the advice is on this. This gme hype has gotten me interested in investing. However with gme I feel this can easily go over my head (I understand the very basics of it. Wall Street counting it as a lost and shorting so retail investors buy it causing price to go up)\n\nAs a newbie, would it be smart for me to invest $500 more or would I be over my head in this \n\n\nThere is also a 3 day transfer period on wealthsimple. So any money I want to invest will be available 3 days later so there is the risk.

{"_id":{"$oid":"605bb2ef5df7eedfb49c1cc6"},"id":"mcezan","fullname":"t3_mcezan","selftext":"I'm not going to mention the ticker because of HF data mining, but it's the first 4 letters of the company's name.\n\nCuriosity Stream, in case you're not familiar, is a relatively new streaming service that produces their own content and focuses on fact-based programming. Their service costs $20/year, and there are frequently discount deals available for 25% off. Note, that's per year, which comes out to $1.67/month; compare to sector behemoths Netflix @ $8.99/month for basic or $17.99/month for premium and HBO Max @ $15/month. That tells me that if Curiosity Stream gains significant mainstream market share, there's a lot of potential for increased revenue per customer, but in the meantime, it's inexpensive for prospective customers to try out.\n\nNext point, this isn't some little fly-by-night operation. A lot of the same people who were involved in the Discovery Channel are involved with Curiosity Stream, including their founder, John Hendricks, who also founded the Discovery Channel, and their board includes several big names from the entertainment industry. The way I see them, they're basically the streaming-era reincarnation of the Discovery Channel from the 90s, before reality TV became popular and Deadliest Catch set the format trend on the channel. Among their planned original content releases for 2021 is a documentary series on Jane Goodall's conservation efforts with chimps in the Congo, produced in partnership with the Jane Goodall Institute, and featuring unreleased footage from a three-decade span. Can you apes honestly say that doesn't sound like a series worth checking out?\n\nWhat I like even more is that I see their name all over YouTube. They seem to sponsor a LOT of educational YouTubers, and they've partnered with Nebula, a small streaming service founded by YouTubers to circumvent YouTube's advertising policies and content filter, so you can subscribe to Curiosity Stream and get Nebula for free. Their YouTube presence and educational focus means they have a lot of exposure to younger demographics, who could grow up thinking of Curiosity Stream with the same fondness that I remember the Discovery Channel of old.\n\nThey made an IPO in 2020, becoming the first educational streaming provider to go public, and their  share price quickly more than doubled from $10 to its peak at $24. It dropped back down and seems to be stabilizing around $17, but in the downtrending markets of the past week, it's dropped below $15, which I personally believe is a very attractive entry opportunity.\n\nThe one professional analysis I've found set its target price at $25. I'm relatively new to trading, so I don't know how much I should buy into that one analysis, but yesterday's Q4 and FY results were very strong. From [https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210323006005/en/CuriosityStream-Announces-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2020-Financial-Results](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210323006005/en/CuriosityStream-Announces-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2020-Financial-Results):\n\n* Revenue for the full year 2020 of $39.6 million, up from $18.0 million in 2019;\n* Gross margin for the full year 2020 at 61%, consistent with gross margin of 62% for the full year 2019;\n* Net loss for the full year 2020 was $(38.6) million compared to net loss of $(42.5) million for the full year 2019;\n* EBITDA for the full year 2020 was $(38.6) million compared to EBITDA of $(44.1) million for the full year of 2019; and\n* Ending cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and investments totaled $42.4 million as of December 31, 2020.\n\nThey are also projecting $71 million in revenue for the upcoming year, an 80% increase over this year, after more than doubling it this year compared to last. Holy revenue growth, Batman!\n\nThe chart shows what looks like a golden cross about to form on the 1M, 3M, and 6M time scales, although today's 1D chart is pretty ugly (unless you're buying the dip). The price is currently at the bottom Bollinger band, with a downward trend, but the SMA has hovered around $17 for the past two weeks after finding support at $14-16 for the previous three months:\n\n[Here is a pretty chart for you crayon-munching apes](https://preview.redd.it/dvaxv01tx0p61.jpg?width=1069&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=25e5b99097ad012424d862cc2d88f7325bed75b2)\n\nThe stock broke its bullish run (green lines) after peaking at $24 in February, moving into a bearish wedge (red lines) that should be resolving within the next week or so, somewhere around $14. From the DD I've been reading, it seems that wedge resolution should lead to a breakout one way or the other, and with the upward support diagonal and the strength of the company after yesterday's report, I'd be surprised to see a negative breakout. There's also a support diagonal forming with a slight upward trend (blue lines), which could be the start of a new bullish run.\n\nIn my smooth-brained ape opinion (which, to be clear, is not financial advice), this ticker looks appealing at any entry under $15 in the short-to-medium term, and appealing at any recent price in the long term. Based on the fundamentals, I feel like it's a strong candidate for a long position, that will almost certainly rise above $20 in the next year or two and could feasibly double its value more than once within the next 5 years. And while they almost certainly won't be the next Netflix at $500+ per share, I would not be surprised to see their price rise into triple-digits over the next decade if they are able to sustain their strong growth trend. They seem well-poised to capitalize on this year's explosive growth with new original content.\n\nThis is my first DD here, so please poke holes in it and tell me what my smooth brain missed.\n\nTL;DR - Curiosity Stream (the Discovery Channel of the streaming era) looks like a strong candidate for either a long position or a medium-term swing trade, but I've only been trading since February and would appreciate either confirmation bias or constructive criticism","created_utc":"2021-03-24 15:55:11","num_comments":9,"score":8,"upvote_ratio":0.79,"is_original_content":false,"permalink":"/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mcezan/what_are_your_thoughts_on_curiosity_stream/","title":"What are your thoughts on Curiosity Stream?","author":"capn-redbeard-ahoy","firstseen":"2021-03-24 21:45:19.590503"}

This is my own opinion and I do not give financial advice. Use all of this information at your own risk, this is not financial advice.* \n\nalso btw this is not entirely my own research, I just turned it into text format. *Please fact check for any misinformation.* \n\nOk, now lets get down to the weeds. I am not making a TLDR, someone in the comments can do that, this post is for brains with many wrinkle. \n\nTo get started, lets look at a case study, the Chinese city of Ordos. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[City of Ordos, Inner Mongolia, China](https://preview.redd.it/v0otrz168fo61.png?width=1300&format=png&auto=webp&s=ec18aed063a49a058a2a4e8cf7607eb5631d44d5)\n\nFrom afar, this city looks like any other, and this stock photo, makes it looks like it active like any other emerging city. The City of Ordos, like many other cities in China, are pre-planned from the ground up. **Ordos was built to house and serve 1,000,000 people. However, Ordos only has 150,000 people (according to the government).** After natural resources were found near the city in the early 2000s, there was a plan to expand the city. The gov't built housing, schools, hospitals, museums, and public art. **The only things missing, which you might interpret as very important for a city are, supermarkets, department stores, and bars. hmmmmm... kinda sus...** \n\nHere's where it gets better, **even though the city is only has 15% of its designed capacity living there, nearly 100% of the housing units are owned by citizens.** I believe the majority of these owners have no intention of ever moving into these homes because the city literally has nothing to do in it. (no bars, super markets, stores). It would be impossible to live in the city comfortably. \n\nOrdos is not the only city in China like this. If we look at vacancy rates (across all of China), we can see a troubling pattern. \n\n|Year|Vacancy rate|\n|:-|:-|\n|2013|20.9%|\n|2015|21.7%|\n|2017|22.6%|\n\nWhat's even crazier is the fact that 1/5 of all urban homes, or 65 million homes are vacant. \n\n**China has a housing crisis, that may be worse than 2008.** \n\nOk now that we have established a growing problem, lets travel back in time. China is a growing nation that is developing its economy at lighting speed. The way they accomplished this was by proving cheap labor, and manufactuing items for very cheap, and selling them. This is how they grew their GDP so quickly. The problem with provision cheap labor is that it also means your population is working for low wages. You can only compare with the entire world economy for so long before wages naturally start to rise, an your products become less competitive. That is why much of the manufacturing has moved to other Asian countries. **I believe the only way for China to effectively continue to grow it's GDP is by ecourging consumer spending.** There is little left to invest in( roads, bridges, airports etc, that provide instant good returns). The government is constrained by the amount they collect in taxes and debt (around 40% income tax rates). The only way left for China to improve their GDP is i by increasing consumer spending. In order for that to happen, consumers need to gain trust, and spend their savings. **At the current moment, 32% of GDP is consumer spending.** Below is a chart that compare that number to other countries:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Country|% of GDP (consumption) (2017)|\n|:-|:-|\n|USA|\\~75%|\n|UK|\\~68%|\n|Japan|\\~60%|\n|Germany|\\~58%|\n|Korea|\\~49%|\n|China|32%|\n\nAnother bad sign for China is that consumption as a percentage of GDP has actually been decreasing, not increasing. **In 1995 it was around 50% of GDP, now it is only 32%.**\n\nThere may be many reasons for this decline. China does not have a good Social Security system. Citizens need to save for themselves, and thereof are less likely to spend their hard earned cash on anything not essential. Income tax is also very high. In some parts of the country, the effective tax rate can be as high as 40% or more, which is insane. So, in order to preserve wealth, where do the people look to, you guesses it, HOUSING!!! Data to back this up is by looking at home ownership rates, and comparing them to other wealthy nations. Here is another handy dandy chart:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Country|Home Ownership Rate|\n|:-|:-|\n|China|90%|\n|Singapore|\\~88%|\n|Mexico|\\~70%|\n|Australia|\\~64%|\n|Canada|\\~62%|\n|USA|\\~60%|\n\nWhat's even more concerning is the fact that a majority of the recent home purchases are for second and third homes. If this rings a bell, look back to the early 2000s USA. Here is a graph representing home purchases in Urban China. \n\n[Percent of home purchases by purchase number. ](https://preview.redd.it/7knr02hqffo61.png?width=1504&format=png&auto=webp&s=7722e062b2732978ee28348fbe0d8c8cee70e0b4)\n\nNow this begs the question, if everyone is owns multiple homes, who is going to live in them. And the answer is... well... no one. Not a soul. This is proven by the vacancy rates shown above. Comparing vacancy rates to other countries will show the true picture of the problem at hand. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Country|Vacancy rate|\n|:-|:-|\n|Spain|28%|\n|China|22%|\n|France|17%|\n|USA|13%|\n|Denmark|13%|\n|Canada|8%|\n\nSince China opened up the housing market to the public, it has been the number one asset class to store wealth in. I mean just look at this graph:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Make sure to note currency is in Yuan, not USD](https://preview.redd.it/42kroij5hfo61.png?width=1950&format=png&auto=webp&s=a33f1d2f5788766c06e5d335248b220f2c3967cb)\n\nThe reason for this, besides all the info above, is that the public has no trust in the stock market because it is so volatile, and no one likes bonds, well because they're fucking bonds and give no meaningful return, so no one buys them. This leaves only housing for people to store their money in. **Also, China's demographics are going to bite them in the ass, and bite them HARD.** Because of the one child policy, **China has an ever increasing population,** with not enough young people to support them. Also, because of the dame policy, there is an embalmed of the sexes. **Men out number Women by millions.** \n\n[Population Chart, Men on Left, Women on Right](https://preview.redd.it/tbk2e573ifo61.png?width=1672&format=png&auto=webp&s=6efbfa9fdde9a6a4836e56fee15e3018092fca3e)\n\nBecause of this imbalance, the Women in China have been able to get very picky with their men. T**hey can almost demand that they have fancy cars, watches, jewelry, and of course, HOUSES.** Its almost a prerequisite to own a house in order to get married. Imagine if you manage to find some dream girl, and she turns you down just because, you do not own a house. This forces men to you guesses it, buy houses. Home ownership studies prove this by comparing home ownership rates, with the sex imbalance. In cities where there is a greater imbalance of Men to Women, housing prices are higher. Around 30% of home sales are solely attributed to men wanting to get married. **And men are getting desperate to buy these homes.** Men are increasingly buying homes that have not even been built yet. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n1nnikeejfo61.png?width=1844&format=png&auto=webp&s=ff352aeea3da8c4ef060f6f64bb20d09d0d00c71\n\nImagine spending money on a home, that has not even been built yet. This is a sign that there may be a bubble, and a dangerously large bubble. **The frenzied home buying is a sign the housing market is speculative,** not based on reality. Because these retards believe the housing prices will only go up (like our stocks), they will put down any amount of money necessary to buy these homes. The problem is  China's demographics (they're getting way too fucking old). **China's over 55 age group will increase by 120 million** (or you know, the entire population of fucking japan). By the end of century, the overall population of china will be halved. **The majority of home buyers right now are aged between 20 and 50. Otherwise known as the segment that will turn into the old people.** There will be fewer people around(low supply), and this round of new old people will have drastically different needs than the current cohort. 10 years ago rapid urbanization would bring enough migrants into the city to keep housing prices rising (high demand). This max influx of migrants was canceling the effects of aging(lower demand) on the housing market. The thing is, today the urban growth rate is shrinking, and the people moving, on average are older than before. Because the growth rate is droppings, and the people moving are older, the effects of migration propping up the housing market are shrinking. And to add fuel to the fire, it is getting increasingly harder to find jobs, which is forcing people to move out back into the country(negative effect in housing prices). **Supply is going to catch up with demand, and it is not going to be pretty when it happens.** \n\nhmm... this all sounds pretty bad, but so what if china's housing market crashes? how will that effect me, and more importantly how can i make some tendies in the process. \n\nto that I say hold your horses, we haven't even gotten to the worst part yet. \n\n**For some context, in China, housing directly contributes to 15% of GDP. This metric signifactly under calculates it's importance in their economy. When everything related to real estate is accounted for, 30% of GDP is related to real estate. 30 FUCKING PERCENT OF CHINA'S GDP IS CORRELATED WITH HOUSING!!! WHAT THE FUCKKKKKKK!!!!!!** For comparison, because everything needs a comparison in order to put in perspective what is going on, here is a graph that compares real estate-related spending to a percent of GDP. \n\n[read the title dipshit](https://preview.redd.it/lmto6mncnfo61.png?width=1636&format=png&auto=webp&s=cba8296eb607641e34b15636d0e68c3a3d88cc2f)\n\nChina's largest banks : *Bank of China*, *Industrial and Commercial Bank of China*, and *Agricultural Bank of China*, all have mortgages on their books. They are all heavily dependent on these mortgages. A 20% drop in real estate related activities could lead to a drop of 5-10% in GDP. **Basically, China is over exposed to the housing market.** according to the IMF(lol), **if China's demand for housing drops just by 1%, global GDP could drop by .25%, which is a lot.** There is one thing that cannot be ignored, in the US before 2008, people were taking out loans with no down payment, this is very different in China. For fist homes, a down payment averages around 30%, and for second homes it can be as high as a 70% down payment. Also, people are not being given shitty loans like in the US. Instead, people are saving up their own money, sacrificing everything, to buy these homes. Now this is a sign that there may actually not be a 2008 level event, but that does not mean it is not healthy for the Chinese economy. Because everyone is buying these 2nd and 3rd homes that they willl never use, that money is not being spent on innovation, manufacturing, and other economic drivers. **Because banks have so much housing as collateral, they cannot give loans out to companies that would use the capital too innovate.**  \n\nAnd, to put Elon musk's spaceship flames right over the already gigantic shitshow fire, Local governments could default as well. Because local governments are responsible for providing care, but don't really collect taxes(all tax revenue goes to Beijing), **they created shell companies called LGFVs to generate revenue.** The local governments technically own all of the land, so they created these shell companies to take on debt for the local governments. The government gave the LGFVs free land, so they could get loans to pay for all the care they are required to give by Beijing. The LGFVs can take out loans from banks, using the land as collateral. **This separates the debt from the local governments, but in reality they are in massive debt, and if housing prices fall, they could default on these loans.** \n\nSo basically there are 2 scenarios that I can think of:\n\n**Scenario 1: Housing prices fall**\n\nIn this scenario, by natural forces of supply and demand caused by the disastrous one child policy, Housing prices begin to fall, leading to a 2008 level event where basically everything is worthless. This would not only fuck over China, but the entire world's economy, just like in 2008 with the US. Local governments will also lose around 30% of their revenue due to LGVF's no longer being able to take out loans with land as collateral. \n\n**Scenario 2: Housing prices do not fall**\n\nIn this scenario, China is still fucked, just not the rest of the world so much. Instead of everyone paying the price, China's people will pay the most. If housing prices continue to rise, it will be harder for farmers and low income individuals to move into cities and join civilization. China needs these low income people to continue moving into cities in order for housing prices to keep rising, but at some point, no one will be able to afford these houses. Also, there will be million of men that will have no hope of marrying because they cannot find a house to buy. \n\nThe only counter argument i can think of is that China's government is so powerful, they could instantly implement reforms that would solve the crisis. The only thing is, will they? They have a history of failures like the one child policy. **And they could end up fucking it up even more trying to intervene.** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, how do us reatrds profit.

However, I believe there's a good chance that we are in for a nice surprise üöÄ\n\nWhat should we be looking for in the upcoming ER? Well, I made a list below with the things I'm looking forward to.\n\n* Facebook settlement (Not sure if this will be included in this ER. This could be huge)\n* Huawei patent sale. This one could turn out to be the most important thing because it could help us to better understand the value of BlackBerry's 38k patent portfolio.\n* AtHoc and Spark customer growth.\n* IVY updates. Any actual numbers here would be golden.\n* Rebranding + ongoing strategy to gain more customers\n* Next year guidance of course\n\nThe technicals are looking really good and with a good ER, we could be in for some delicious tendies. Currently, BlackBerry is heavily oversold on the hourly, with a lot of room for the MACD to really spike up. We have a strong trendline dating back to November 2020, every time we touched that trendline it bounced straight back up!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vg9juklkc0p61.png?width=2048&format=png&auto=webp&s=dbb6e812f230e0e86f31bf9eeba5262f42b7ba50\n\nLast ER John Chen gave us a little hint regarding the revenue, John Chen is known for being a man of his words!

The Company has its head office in Rotterdam, The Netherlands, and a Management Office in Luzern, Switzerland. The Group is comprised of 134 companies with 47 manufacturing and 87 assembly operations in more than 100 countries. Hunter Douglas employs about 22,750 people and had sales in 2019 of USD 3.7 billion.\n\nHunter Douglas - Investor Relations\n\nHunter Douglas N.V. (\"Hunter Douglas\") and Bergson Holdings B.V. (\"Bergson\"), a holding company owned and controlled by Mr. R. Sonnenberg who holds 82.7% of the common shares and 99.4% of the preference shares and accordingly over 90% of the total issued capital of Hunter Douglas, today announced that Bergson is offering to acquire (the \"Offer\") all of Hunter Douglas' outstanding common shares for EUR 64 in cash per share (cum dividend).\n\nThe offer price represents a premium of 18.8% over the volume-weighted average price of  the last 30 days (VWAP) and of 25.5% over the last closing price of EUR 51.\n\n\nThe Story:\n\nCurrently Bergson is bidding for an all cash offer at 64‚Ç¨ . The intention of the bidding investment holding Bergson is to delist this stock from the market and take it fully private. Obiously, as you can see below, the holdout shareholders consider this offer as too low compared to its direct competitors which are:\n\n-Somfy (FR)\n\n-Nien Made (Taiwan)\n\nCheck out the valuation ratios as follows.\n\n\n\nr/wallstreetbets - Special Event - Hunter Douglas - Cash offer 64 ‚Ç¨\nValuation Ratios versus its peers , Hunter Douglas\n\nBottom Line:\n\nAs we can easily see in this ratios, Bergson is trying to aquire Hunter Douglas way too cheap without taking notice of the interest of the remaining shareholders. According to Dutch take over law the official bid has been brought forward by 12 December last year. This means that the offer is valid for 10 weeks and can be extended only once by another 10 weeks. So the offer will run out mid of April 2021. This opens the door either for a increase in the mandatory bid or the stockholders will take this issue to the enterprise chamber in Amsterdam and demand a revalutaion of this offer.\n\nFor details of mandatory offers concerning Dutch law see this link:\n\nGuide to mandatory offers and squeezes\n\nFacts:\n\nFree float common shares = 10%\n\nFree float preffered shares = 0.6%\n\nBid = 64‚Ç¨\n\nValuation versus peers = 118.50‚Ç¨\n\nUpside = 85%\n\nLeaving a very narrow free float of shares available in the market (<10%) can set this stock up for a major short squeeze.

If they can't prove a claim, tag a mod and the author will get banned.\n      * Note: This only applies for things which are stated as objective facts.\n* A submission contains NO-NO CONTENT\n   * WSB is a big sub and to avoid us being shilled at every corner, we automatically remove content that mentions small cap stocks (Below $1B market cap), cryptocurrencies, NFT, and SPACs.\n* A submission is purely political\n   * Part of what makes WSB great is that we don't do politics here. No one cares about your political opinion unless it makes you money. WSB does not have an agenda or political goal.\n* A submission includes advertising, self-promotion, fundraising or begging\n   * Come on. I mean really.

Symancyk and Kathy Vrabeck will not stand for reelection at the Annual Meeting.\n\n- The planned slate of director nominees for the Annual Meeting are: Alan Attal, Ryan Cohen, Paul Evans, Reginald Fils-Aim√©, Jim Grube, George Sherman, William Simon, Carrie Teffner, and Kurt Wolf.\n\n- If a Board member must be replaced during the Standstill Period and RC owns at least 4.0% of the Company‚Äôs then-outstanding Common Stock and (y) 2,789,878 shares of Common Stock RC can recommend a person to be on the board (clairfication: to replace RC, Attal, Grube or other Replacement Board members - if needed.  Thanks u/OG_Kushions)\n\n- Ryan Cohen is not accepting any compensation as a Board member\n\n- RC cannot seek, alone or in concert with others, representation on the Board, except as specifically permitted\n\nFrom u/YouAreAPyrate\n\n- The Slate of Board Members is not definitive. [From the 3/23/21 ER](https://news.gamestop.com/node/18661/html#i3ad65c8584a445ee94e4314f67ce616c_109)\n \n>As of the date of this Form 10-K, the Board has not determined the definitive slate of nominees but currently expects that the following incumbent directors will retire from the Board at the 2021 Annual Meeting: Lizabeth Dunn, Paul Evans, Raul J. Fernandez, Reginald Fils-Aim√©, William Simon, James K. Symancyk, Carrie W. Teffner and Kathy P. Vrabeck. The contemplated retirements are not because of a disagreement with us on any matter relating to our operations, policies or practices.  \n\n**Ryan Cohen agreed to a Standstill Period.**\n\nStandstill Provision\n\nFrom January 11, 2021 until either 30 days before the deadline for the submission of director nominations by stockholders for the Company‚Äôs 2022 annual meeting OR 120 days before the first anniversary of the 2021 Annual Meeting whichever is first.  So around March 1, 2022\n\n*Calculation of time* \nIf the meeting is June 1, 2022 and the nominations must be submitted 60 days before that April 1 then the 30 days prior to that would mean March 1, 2022\nor \n\nIf the meeting is June 1, 2022 the 120 days before that is March 1.\n\n**Limits on what Ryan Cohen can do during the Standstill Period**\n\nDuring the Standstill Period, Ryan Cohen cannot:\n\n- nominate or recommend for nomination any person for election at any annual or special meeting of the Company‚Äôs stockholders or otherwise seek representation on the Board\n\n- submit, participate in or be the proponent of any proposal for consideration at, or bring any other business before, any annual or special meeting of the Company‚Äôs stockholders \n\n- seek the removal of any member of the Board\n\n- initiate, encourage or participate in any ‚Äúvote no,‚Äù ‚Äúwithhold‚Äù or similar campaign with respect to any annual or special meeting of the Company‚Äôs stockholders or encourage anyone to do so.\n\n- vote against directors nominated by the Board or recommendations of the Board UNLESS both [Institutional Shareholder Services Inc.](https://www.issgovernance.com/) and [Glass Lewis & Co., LLC](https://www.glasslewis.com/) recommend otherwise, then RC can vote in accordance with the ISS and Glass Lewis recommendations; and RC can vote in its sole discretion as to publicly announced proposals relating to a merger, acquisition, disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company that requires a stockholder vote.\n- Take over or buy out GME  to own or control more than 19.9% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock without prior board approval. He also cannot encourage a third party to join in a merger, tender (or exchange) offer, acquisition, recapitalization, restructuring, disposition, business combination or other extraordinary transaction involving the Company.  \n\n- If Ryan Cohen buys more than 20.0% or more of the outstanding shares without prior Board approval, he will be an ‚Äúinterested stockholder‚Äù of the Company (normally its 15% ) and be subject to restrictions on any business combination for the next three years \n\n- cannot form a group or solicit proxies to consent or to vote for the election of individuals to the Board or to approve stockholder proposals, or become a ‚Äúparticipant‚Äù in any contested ‚Äúsolicitation‚Äù for the election of directors\n\n- cannot call a special meeting of Stockholders or make any proposal for consideration by stockholders at any annual or special meeting of stockholders of the Company, \n\n- make a request for any stockholder list or other Company books and records\n\n\n\nOf course none of this is financial or legal advice. I can read and had some extra time so I wrote this up. Use it however you wish. And if I got anything wrong, let me know.\n\nedits. formatting/grammar","created_utc":"2021-03-24 07:46:43","num_comments":129,"score":2811,"upvote_ratio":0.95,"is_original_content":false,"permalink":"/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mc3o14/ryan_cohen_is_going_to_transform_gamestop_but_for/","title":"Ryan Cohen is going to transform GameStop but for now he's limited in what he can do","author":"Berningforchange","firstseen":"2021-03-24 21:45:22.209255"}

Some analysts predict it will happen much sooner.\n\n\\- VW can exploit something Tesla doesn‚Äôt have much of yet: scale. Dozens of brands that fill every nook and cranny of the auto market‚Äîand sales last year of 9.3 million vehicles (compared to TSLA's 0.5 million).\n\n\\- By 2025, VW and its partners will have more than 35,000 public chargers around the world, and planning half a dozen battery factories in EU.\n\n\\- VW aims to sell 26 million EVs  in the next 10 years\n\n\\- Other legacy auto makers following suit (e.g. GM planning to phase out diesel cars by 2035, Hyundai planning almost two dozen new models, Renualt having a super hit in EU with model Zoe, Ford's Mustang Mach-E)\n\n\\- Chinese companies rolling out budget EV models\n\n\\- Tons of new companies/SPACs (Rivian, Lucid, etc)\n\n\\- Just like netflix that paved the way for streaming video is now facing great competition from \"legacy\" companies like disney, HBO, amazon, etc, TSLA will also face the same struggle with the EV market, specially when the giants like Apple, Amazon, Google have EV ambitions of themselves\n\n\\- (maybe positive for TSLA) the biggest automaker in the world Toyota, still not fully committed to EV, and some major automakers like BMW do not think \"only EV after year xxxx\" is a good strategy because there are like 160 countries/markets to consider\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**My Opinion:**\n\n\\- good article but would have been nice to get some analysis about the software/AI aspect, as that is where TSLA is way ahead of others and legacy car makers seem to be struggling with\n\n\\- Chinese companies barely mentioned (and also aspects such as the recent Chinese rule of not using TSLA cars in military sensitive areas due to the cameras, which may give acceleration to LADAR based cars rather than camera based Evs, and I doubt TSLA will shift to that one..)\n\n*What do you think?*\n\nI thin the EV pie is very big and there is room for many. TSLA will be dominant for at least the next few years (maybe until 2025) and then maybe others will catch up if they play their cards right and some politics (like China) plays in their favour. \n\n*PS: I don't have a position in TSLA (wanted to get in when it dipped but was waiting for sub 550 which didn't happen). I have small position in VW and Nio.*","created_utc":"2021-03-24 04:53:02","num_comments":47,"score":44,"upvote_ratio":0.73,"is_original_content":false,"permalink":"/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mc12k5/the_end_of_teslas_dominance_may_be_closer_than_it/","title":"The End of Tesla‚Äôs Dominance May Be Closer Than It Appears (Bloomberg)","author":"futureIsYes","firstseen":"2021-03-24 21:45:22.213479"}

Countdown restarts at 60 days as soon as they receive that info.\n* SEC asks for extra time because their brains have grown smoother by the day in the current market environment. They get an extra 60 days.\n* SEC objects. It does not take effect. (In my personal opinion, I find this unlikely, as this amendment was clearly written as a companion/follow-up to DTC-003.)\n\n# ü¶çüí¨  Anything I can do while I sit on my ass and wait for this?\n\nThe SEC invites interested persons to submit views, data, and arguments for or against NSCC-801. You can submit it by either:\n\n* Using the form at [http://www.sec.gov/rules/sro.shtml](http://www.sec.gov/rules/sro.shtml)\n* Emailing them at [rule-comments@sec.gov](mailto:rule-comments@sec.gov) with File Number SR-NSCC-2021-801 in the subject line.\n\nPlease don‚Äôt fill their mailbox with apespeak and emojis, but making your opinion on NSCC-801 heard is never a bad thing. You are a participant in the market, one who may be affected by this rule if it passes, so your voice matters, and this is an opportunity for the SEC to hear from retail investors, who historically don‚Äôt speak up much on these things.\n\n# ü¶çüí¨   Hey asshole! You fucked up your DD!\n\nPlease let me know ASAP so I can make the correction. Most of this was written around 2AM CST, so I can't make any promises that I didn't flub one of the details when reading these filings.\n\n# ü¶çüí¨   This is handy info for a chimp like me.

{"_id":{"$oid":"605bb2f25df7eedfb49c1d28"},"id":"mc0q2m","fullname":"t3_mc0q2m","selftext":"Hello, fellow apes,\n\nI come here with some analysis that I did in my free time because I was intrigued to apply some things that I have learned over the course of time. This is not financial advice, I repeat: **THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE**. This is merely an analysis I did for fun and I advise you to take it with a grain of salt because I might be very wrong.\n\nAlso, I didn't really have the time to make very pretty-looking graphs since I spent most of the time hunting for data and about 20 minutes compiling all this together so please bear with me.\n\nFirst, let's look at the failure to deliver the GME stock. (Data was taken from the SEC: [https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm](https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm))\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8tfms7p91yo61.png?width=4200&format=png&auto=webp&s=1c6ec55a6e5052031649dbd4482fe9c252306fc4\n\nWe see that most failures to delivers were during mid-January when the stock shot up to about 480 bucks a stock. We also see massive failure to deliver during the period of mid-October, if someone could think about a reason for that, please let me know as well because I can't really think of any right now.\n\nThe point I'm trying to make here is that failure to deliver isn't really that bad as of February 26, 2021, with a mere \\~300k stocks being failed to deliver on that day. (For context: u/DeepFuckingValue owns 100k of GME stock in his portfolio, also if you're reading this you are a legendary man, I have mad respect for you.)\n\nBut does that mean the shorts have covered? Maybe, but it gets better. In the image below you will see a simple ordinary least squares model I ran with the stock price at market close (adjusted\\_close) as the independent variable and 3 dependent variables, i.e. Quantity (Fails) which is the number of stocks failed to be delivered, volume\\_traded\\_in\\_millions that is the quantity of stock being traded in millions on that day, and Volume\\_of\\_Options which is the average options that were in the money on that day.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nl8hd93c1yo61.png?width=610&format=png&auto=webp&s=aba5091c0665c656c12258a0a3648eb90dcdf52b\n\nWe see that failure to deliver isn't statistically significant in this OLS model. But the volume of stock traded and the volume of options traded in the money is. If I do not include the volume of options in the model, we see a positive effect of the volume of stock traded on the stock price. This means that for each million that is added to the trade volume, the GME stock price on average goes up by about 70 cents. But as soon as we add the volume of options traded in the money to the model, we see a negative effect with the price of GME dropping on an average by a dollar for every 1 million increase in stock being traded.\n\nThis is rather interesting because what it's telling us is that there might be a correlation between the volume of options being traded in the money and the volume of stock being traded. The argument I'm trying to propose is that even though the private enterprises (HF's, IB's whoever it is) shorted the stock, they don't have to deliver a lot of stocks unless some shady shit is going on. BUT, as long as they continue to short the stock or even sell covered calls, and these calls expire in the money, the stock will stay up in price. How up? I don't know, no one does. The more options expire in the money, the more this gamma-squeeze will continue to happen. It may also lead to more failure to deliveries in the future since a lot of stock is held by retail investors.\n\nOnly time will tell about contracts expiring in the money, and if these contracts were shorted, well, the shorts are going to have to cover driving the price up due to scarcity in supply and increase in demand.\n\nBy the way, the data runs from August 3, 2020 to February 26, 2021 and a snapshot of my data is attached below.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/22yef3ge1yo61.png?width=1409&format=png&auto=webp&s=8cc32b6aebef3a363b5c0499126d90556b5a2a3b\n\nGodspeed to all of you.

{"_id":{"$oid":"605bb2f25df7eedfb49c1d2e"},"id":"mbx510","fullname":"t3_mbx510","selftext":" WSB was never moving into silver. The media got the story wrong.\n\nThink about who reads weekend financial news. Old people. The last time silver had a real short squeeze was in the 70s, and these people are now in their 70s. Who clicks on ads? Basically only old people. Dealers of gold and silver love to advertise, and media likes to make money through click-through revenue. Of course they are going to post all these stories of small unit silver selling out at dealers, they will get higher click through and sales kickbacks from the targeted ads on these articles.\n\nIf you are purchasing SLV thinking you are purchasing silver on the open market, you could not be more wrong. **Purchasing SLV is the best way for an investor to shoot themselves directly in the face.**\n\nI have done some research on SLV and I have come to believe that it is essentially a vehicle for JPM and other banks to crush retail investors by manipulating the silver market.\n\nSo what are these games of manipulation that the banks have played?\n\n**The general theme could be described as this: If banks hold the silver, the price is allowed to rise, but if you hold the silver, the price is forced to fall.**\n\nJeff Currie from Goldman had an interview on February 4th where he dismissed the idea of a silver short squeeze, and he had one line that was especially profound,\n\n‚ÄúIn terms of thinking how are you going to create a squeeze, the shorts are the ETFs, the ETFs buy the physical, they turn around and sell on the COMEX.‚Äù ‚Äì Jeff Currie of Goldman\n\nThis was shocking to holders of SLV, because SLV is a long-only silver ETF. They simply buy silver as inflows occur and keep that silver in a vault. They have no price risk, if the price of silver declines, it‚Äôs the investors who lose money, not the ETF itself, so there is no need to hedge by shorting on the COMEX. Further, their prospectus prohibits them from participating in the futures market at all. So how is the ETF shorting silver?\n\nThey aren‚Äôt. The iShares SLV ETF is not shorting silver, its custodian, JP Morgan is shorting silver. This is what Jeff Currie meant when he said the shorts are the ETFs. Moreover, he said it with a tone like this fact should be plainly obvious to all of the dumb retail investors. He truly meant what he said.\n\nWhat is a custodian you ask? The custodian of the ETF is the entity that actually buys, sells, and stores the silver. All iShares does is market the ETF and collect the fees. When money comes in they notify their custodian and their custodian sends them an updated list of silver bars that are allocated to the ETF.\n\nBut no real open market purchases of silver are occurring. Instead, JPM (and a few sub custodian banks) accumulated a large amount of silver, segmented it off into LBMA vaults, and simply trade back and forth with the ETFs as they receive inflows. **Thus, ensuring that ETF inflows never actually impact the true open market trade of silver.** When the SLV receives inflows, JPM sells silver from the segmented off vaults, and then proceeds to short silver on the futures exchange. As the price drops, silver investors become disheartened and sell their SLV, thus selling the silver back to JPM at a lower price. It‚Äôs a continuous scalp trade that nets JPM and the banks billions in profits. Here‚Äôs a diagram to help you sort it out:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[reduce, reuse, recycle](https://preview.redd.it/ewkug02chwo61.png?width=864&format=png&auto=webp&s=a424d1a61b93e9a37541cdf8ff19591a3df9fb88)\n\nAn even more clear admission that SLV doesn‚Äôt impact the real silver market came on February 3rd when it changed its prospectus to state that it might not be possible to acquire additional silver in the near future. What does this even mean? Why would it not be possible to acquire additional silver? As long as the ETF is willing to pay a higher price, more silver will be available to purchase. But if the ETF doesn‚Äôt participate in the real silver market, that‚Äôs actually not the case. What SLV was admitting here, was that the silver in the JPM segmented off vaults might run out, and that they refuse to bid up the price of silver in the open market. They will not purchase additional silver to accommodate inflows, beyond what JPM will allow them to.\n\nThe real issue here is that purchasing SLV doesn‚Äôt actually impact the market price of silver one bit. The price is determined completely separately on the futures exchange. SLV doesn‚Äôt purchase futures contracts and then take delivery of silver, it just uses JPM as a custodian who allocates more silver to their vault from an existing, controlled supply. This is an extremely strange phenomenon in markets, and its unnatural.\n\nFor example, when millions of people buy GME stock, it puts a direct bid under the price of the stock, causing the price to rise.\n\nWhen millions of people put money into the USO oil ETF, that fund then purchases oil futures contracts directly, which puts a bid under the price of oil.\n\nBut when millions of people buy SLV, it does nothing at all to directly impact the price of silver. The price of silver is determined separately, and SLV is completely in the position of price taker.\n\nSo how do we know banks like JPM are shorting on the futures market whenever SLV experiences inflows? Well luckily for us the CFTC publishes the ‚Äòbank participation report‚Äô which shows exactly how banks are positioned on the futures market.\n\nThe chart below shows SLV YoY change in shares outstanding which are evidence of inflows and outflows to the ETF. The orange line is the net short position of all banks participating in the silver futures market. The series runs from April-2007 through February-2021. I use a 12M trailing avg of the banks‚Äô net position to smooth out the awkward lumpiness caused by the fact that futures have 5 primary delivery months per year, and this causes cyclicality in the level of open interest depending on time of year.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2vpm42uehwo61.png?width=849&format=png&auto=webp&s=5feb48c0ce3ce1a2a55280e7ec2f79b8b7f33c0a\n\nIt is evident that as SLV experiences inflows, banks add to short positions on the COMEX, and as SLV experiences outflows they reduce these short positions. What‚Äôs also evident is that the short interest of the banks has grown over time, which is also why silver is ripe for a potential short squeeze, just not by using SLV.\n\nOne other thing that is evident, is that the trend of banks shorting when SLV receives inflows, is starting to break down. Specifically, beginning in the summer of 2020, as deliveries began to surge, the net short interest among banks has actually declined as SLV has experienced inflows. It‚Äôs likely one or more banks see the risk, and the writing on the wall and is trying to exit before a potential squeeze happens (having seen what happened with GME).\n\nFor further evidence of this theme of, ‚ÄúIf banks hold the silver, the price is allowed to rise, but if you hold the silver, the price is forced to fall‚Äù look no further than the deliveries data itself,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e6gnlo7ghwo61.png?width=869&format=png&auto=webp&s=cb6ff867907a4de54a27876835cad96ac00ad46e\n\nYou‚Äôll notice that as long as futures investors didn‚Äôt actually want the silver to be delivered, the price of silver was allowed to rise, but whenever deliveries showed an uptick, the price would begin to fall once again. This is because the shorts know that they can decrease the price of all silver in the world by shorting on the COMEX, and then secure real physical silver from primary dealers to actually make delivery. Why pay a higher price to the dealers when you can simply add to shorts on the COMEX and push the price down, and then acquire the silver you need?\n\nBut just like the graph of the bank net short position, you‚Äôll notice that this relationship started to break down in 2020, and the price has started to rise alongside deliveries. The short squeeze is underway, and the dam is about to break.\n\nAnd lest you think I‚Äôm reaching with my accusations of price manipulation by JPM, why not just listen to what the department of Justice concluded?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fwjolfmhhwo61.png?width=877&format=png&auto=webp&s=6b1804172cace87c2fb285f1f13bad1d5dcef374\n\nFor JPM and the banks involved in the silver market, fines from regulators are just a cost of doing business. The only way to get banks to stop manipulating precious metals markets is to call the bluff, take delivery, and make them feel the losses of their short position.\n\nSLV is by far the largest silver ETF in the world, with 600 million ounces of silver under its control, and its custodian was labeled a criminal enterprise for manipulation of silver markets. Why should silver investors ever put their money into a silver ETF where the entity that controls the silver is actively working against them, or at a minimum is a criminal enterprise?\n\nAnd let me know if you see a trend in the custodial vaults of the other popular silver ETFs:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8kbb08xihwo61.png?width=607&format=png&auto=webp&s=7da347b06b44433082ab041d11f35d1563c8919a\n\nFurther exacerbating the lack of trust one should have in these ETFs, is the fact that they store the metal at the LBMA in London. Unlike the COMEX that has regular independent audits, the LBMA isn‚Äôt required to have independent audits, nor do independent audits occur. I‚Äôm not saying the silver isn‚Äôt there, but why not allow independent auditors in to provide more confidence?\n\nSo what are investors to do in a rigged game like this?\n\nWell, there is currently one ETF that is outside this system, and which actually purchases silver on the open market as it receives inflows. That ETF is PSLV, from Sprott. Founded by Eric Sprott, a billionaire precious metals investor with a stake in nearly ever silver mine in the world, so you know his interests are aligned with the longs of the PSLV ETF (in desiring higher prices for silver via real price discovery). Further, PSLV buys its silver directly, it doesn‚Äôt have a separate entity doing the purchasing, it stores its silver at the Royal Canadian Mint rather than the LBMA, and it is independently audited. By purchasing the PSLV ETF, retail investors can actually acquire 1000oz bars and put a bid under the price of silver in the primary dealer marketplace. And if a premium occurs among primary dealers, deliveries will occur in the futures market.\n\nThis is what is starting to happen right now, a premium has developed among primary dealers, and deliveries on the COMEX have started to surge, while COMEX inventories have begun to decline. And this is happening after PSLV has added just 30 million ounces over 7 weeks (once the small contingent of silver squeezers realized SLV was a scam and started switching). Imagine what will happen if investors create 100 million ounces of demand.\n\nEven a small portion of SLV investors switching to PSLV because **they realize the custodian of SLV is a criminal enterprise**, would create a massive groundswell of demand in the real physical silver market.\n\nAfter the original silver squeeze posts went viral on WSB on 1/27, silver rose massively over the first 3 trading days following it. But on 1/31 a post was made about citadel being long SLV which got 74k upvotes (compared to only 15k on the original silver post). This lead to a fizzling in the momentum for the silver squeeze movement on WSB. However, given what I've explained here about how SLV is a complete scam meant to screw over investors, is it really that much of a surprise?\n\nAdditionally, that post about citadel showed them with $130m in SLV. That's only 0.04% of Citadel's AUM. Do you really think they were pushing silver because 0.04% of their AUM was in SLV? This post also didn't detail the fact that citadel also had short positions on SLV. That's what a market maker does. They have long and short positions in just about everything.\n\nThere are plenty of banks talking about a commodities super cycle, and a ‚Äògreen‚Äô commodity super cycle where they upgrade metals like copper, but they never mention silver. Likely because banks have a massive net short position in silver.\n\nLets dig into the potential for a silver squeeze, starting with the silver market itself.\n\nSilver is priced in the futures market, and its price is based on 1000oz commercial bars. A futures market allows buyers and sellers of a commodity to come to agreement on a price for a specific amount of that commodity at a specific date in the future. Most buyers in the futures market are speculators rather than entities who actually want to take delivery of the commodity. So once their contract date nears, they close out their contracts and ‚Äòroll‚Äô them over to a future date. Historically, only a tiny percentage of the longs take delivery, but the existence of this ability to take delivery is what gives these markets their legitimacy. If the right to take delivery didn‚Äôt exist, then the market wouldn‚Äôt be a true market for silver. Delivery is what keeps the price anchored to reality.\n\nIndustrial players and large-scale investors who want to acquire large amounts of physical silver don‚Äôt typically do it through the futures market. They instead use primary dealers who operate outside of the futures market, because taking delivery of futures is actually a massive pain in the ass. They only do it if they really have to. Deliveries only surge in the futures market when supply is so tight that silver from the primary dealers starts to be priced at a large premium to the futures price, thus incentivizing taking delivery. Despite setting the index price for the entire silver market, the futures exchange is really more of a supplier of last resort than a main player in the physical market.\n\nMost shorts (the sellers) in the futures market also source their silver from sources outside of exchange warehouses for the occasional times they are called to deliver. The COMEX has an inventory of ‚Äòregistered‚Äô silver that is effectively a big pile of silver that exists as a last resort source to meet delivery demand if supply ever gets very tight. But even as deliveries are made each month, you will typically see next to no movement among the registered silver because silver is still available to source from primary dealers.\n\nSo how have deliveries and registered ounces been trending recently?\n\nLet‚Äôs take a quick look at the first quarter deliveries in 2021 compared to the first quarter in previous years:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u6vl4z3lhwo61.png?width=669&format=png&auto=webp&s=97d96e5ee4fcc5553bb267603f764a0378123dec\n\nAfter adding in the 3.6 million ounces of open interest remaining in the current March contract (anyone holding this late in the month is taking delivery), 1Q 2021 would reach 78 million ounces delivered. This is a massive increase relative to previous years, and also an all-time record for Q1 from the data that I can find.\n\nEven more stark, is the chart showing deliveries on a 12-month trailing basis (which I also showed earlier)\n\nNote: You have to view this on an annual basis because the futures market has 5 main delivery months and 7 less active months, so using a shorter time frame would involve cutting out an unequal share of the 5 primary months depending on what time of year it is.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o4wjuwfmhwo61.png?width=724&format=png&auto=webp&s=03f45022e0f2d1702d5c3e0aaa2877a654ed884b\n\nAs you can see from the chart, starting in the month of April 2020, deliveries have gone completely parabolic. While silver doesn‚Äôt need deliveries to spike for a rally to occur, a spike in deliveries is the primary ingredient for a short squeeze. The 2001-2011 rally didn‚Äôt involve a short squeeze for example, so it ‚Äòonly‚Äô caused silver to rise 10x. In the 2020s however, we have a fundamentals-based rally that is running headlong into a surge in deliveries that is extremely close to triggering a short squeeze.\n\nIn fact this is visible when looking at the chart of inventories at the COMEX.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9907dfnnhwo61.png?width=827&format=png&auto=webp&s=45d5859b4c8cd42a66118d62e6d1a97f2364d774\n\nAs you can see from the graph and the chart above, COMEX inventories are beginning to decline at a rapid pace. To explain a bit further, the ‚Äòeligible‚Äô category of COMEX is silver that has moved from registered status to delivered. It is called ‚Äòeligible‚Äô because even though the ownership of the silver has transferred to the entity who requested delivery, they haven‚Äôt taken it out of the warehouse. It is technically eligible become ‚Äòregistered‚Äô if the owner decided to sell it. However, the fact that it is in the eligible category means that it would likely require higher silver prices for the owner to decide to sell.\n\nThe current path of silver in the futures market is that registered ounces are being delivered, they then become eligible, and entities are actually taking their eligible stocks out of COMEX warehouses and into the real physical world. This is a sign that the futures market is currently the silver supplier of last resort. And there are only 127 million ounces left in the registered category. 1/3 of an ounce, or roughly $10 worth of silver is left in the supply of last resort for every American. If just 1% of Americans purchased $1,000 worth of the PSLV ETF, it would be equivalent to 127 million ounces of silver, the entire registered inventory of the COMEX. That‚Äôs how tight this market is.\n\nRight now we are sending most Americans a $1,400 check. If 1% of them converted it to silver through PSLV, this market could truly explode higher.\n\nAnd lest you think this surge in deliveries is going to stop any time soon, just take a look at how the April contract‚Äôs open interest is trending at a record high level:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/olei0ejphwo61.png?width=779&format=png&auto=webp&s=e53aa870cf012bdeff94fb0b9f4d07ab8127813f\n\nIt looks almost unreal. And keep in mind the other high points in this chart were records unto themselves. That light brown line was February 2021, and look how its deliveries compared to previous years:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/llu9bzoqhwo61.png?width=480&format=png&auto=webp&s=cd538ecd2ad375f52aa20ae9932d3b795832f322\n\n12 million ounces were delivered in the month of February 2021. A month that is not a primary delivery month, and which exceeded previous year‚Äôs February totals by a multiple of 4x. Open interest for February peaked at 8 million ounces, which means that an additional 4 million ounces were opened and delivered within the delivery window itself.\n\nApril‚Äôs open interest is currently at a level of 15 million ounces and rising. If it followed a similar pattern to February of intra-month deliveries being added, it could potentially see deliveries of over 20 million ounces. 20 million ounces in a non-active month would be completely unheard of and is more than most primary delivery months used to see.\n\nHere‚Äôs what 20 million ounces delivered in April would look like compared to previous years:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n706c9yrhwo61.png?width=478&format=png&auto=webp&s=78c23017586291a4f7efc66a274c8f1c9a99b4f3\n\nSo just how tenuous is the situation that the shorts have put themselves in (yes CFTC, the shorts did this to themselves)? Well let‚Äôs look at the next active delivery month of May:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ppuloa0thwo61.png?width=860&format=png&auto=webp&s=680a8cfba0f920b008a6660f52f35d45d82557db\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fkh2bdfxhwo61.png?width=271&format=png&auto=webp&s=86c2bf46c9b547b8e0b0cfe109639ad283a832e7\n\nIf a larger percentage than usual take delivery in May, there is easily enough open interest to cause a true run on silver. With 127 million ounces in the registered category, and 652 million ounces in the money, most of it from futures rather than options, the short interest as a % of the float is roughly 513%. Its simply a matter of whether the longs decide to call the bluff of the shorts.\n\nNo long contract holder wants to be left holding the last contract when the COMEX declares ‚Äòforce majeure‚Äô and defaults on its delivery obligations. This means that they will be settled in cash rather than silver, and won‚Äôt get to participate in the further upside of the move right when its likely going parabolic. As registered inventories dwindle, longs are incentivized to take physical delivery just so that they can guarantee they will be able to remain long silver.\n\nOf course, the COMEX could always prevent a default by simply allowing silver to continue trading higher. There is always silver available if the price is high enough. Like the situation with GameStop, the authorities have historically tended to interfere with the silver market during previous short squeezes where longs begin to take delivery in large quantities.\n\nThere were always shares of GME available to purchase, it‚Äôs just that the price had not reached what the longs were demanding quite yet. Given that it was the powerful connected elite of society who were short GME though, the trade was shut down and rigged against the millions of retail traders. The GME short squeeze may indeed continue, because in this situation it‚Äôs millions of small individuals holding GME. While they were able to temporarily prevent purchases of GME, they can‚Äôt force them to sell.\n\nIn the silver short squeeze of the 1970s, that‚Äôs exactly what the authorities forced the Hunt Brothers (the duo that orchestrated the squeeze) to do, they actually forced them to sell. The difference this time is that it‚Äôs not a squeeze orchestrated by a single entity, but rather millions of individuals who are purchasing a few ounces of silver each from around the globe. There is no collusion on the long side among a small group of actors like in the 70s with the Hunt brothers or when Warren Buffet squeezed silver in the late 90s, so there‚Äôs no basis to stop the squeeze.\n\nIn the squeeze of 1979-1980, the regulators literally pulled a ‚ÄòGameStop‚Äô on the silver market. Or in reality, the more recent action with GameStop was regulators pulling a ‚Äòsilver‚Äô. The regulators will try everything in their power to prevent the squeeze from happening again, but this time it‚Äôs not two brothers and a couple of Saudi princes buying millions of ounces each (or just Warren Buffet on his own), but rather it‚Äôs millions of retail investors buying a few ounces each. There is no cornering the market going on. This is actual silver demand running headlong into a silver market that banks have irresponsibly shorted to such a level that they deserve the losses that hit them. They‚Äôve been manipulating and toying with silver investors for decades and profiting off of illegal collusion. Bailing out the banks as their losses pile up would be truly reprehensible action by our government, and tacit admission that our government is ok with a few big banks on the short side stealing billions from small individual investors.\n\nBut what about beyond a short squeeze? Is there any logic to buying silver on a fundamentals basis?\n\nThere are two types of bull markets in silver. One is a fundamentals-based bull market, where silver is undervalued relative to industrial and monetary demand. The second type of silver bull market is a short squeeze. Both types of bull markets have occurred at different points in the past 60 years. However, the 1971-80 market in which the price of silver increased over 30x does was combination of both types of bull markets.\n\nI believe we may be entering another silver bull market like the one that began in the fall of 1971, where both a short squeeze and fundamentals-based rally occur simultaneously.\n\nSmoke alarms are ringing in the silver market, and are signaling another generational bull market.\n\nSo what are these ‚Äòsmoke alarms‚Äô?\n\nI recently went digging through various data to try and quantify where we are in the silver bull/bear market cycle.\n\nI ended up creating an indicator that I like to call SMOEC, pronounced ‚Äòsmoke‚Äô.\n\nThe components of the abbreviation come from the words Silver, Money supply, and Economy.\n\nLets look at the money supply relative to the economy, or GDP. More specifically, if you look at the chart below, you will see the ratio of M3 Money supply to nominal GDP, monthly, from 1960 through 2020.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ltu4vgovhwo61.png?width=852&format=png&auto=webp&s=de4f9f2f0748ca3d86e8cf153175efa78901435d\n\nWhen this ratio is rising, it means that the broad money supply (M3) is increasing faster than the economy, and when it is falling it means that the economy is growing faster than the money supply.\n\nOne thing that is very important when investing in any asset class, is the valuation that you enter the market at. Silver is no different, but being a commodity rather than cash-flow producing asset, how does one value silver? It might not produce cash flows or pay dividends, but it does have a long history of being used as both money and as a monetary hedge, so this is the correct lense through which to examine the ‚Äòvaluation‚Äô level of silver.\n\nEnter the SMOEC indicator. The SMOEC indicator tells you when silver is generationally undervalued and sets off a ‚Äòsmoke alarm‚Äô that is the signal to start buying. In other words, SMOEC is a signal telling you when silver is about to smoke it up and get super high.\n\nBelow, you will see a chart of the SMOEC indicator. SMOEC is calculated by dividing the monthly price of silver by the ratio shown above (M3/GDP).\n\nMore specifically it is: LN(Silver Price / (M3/Nominal GDP))\n\nBelow you will see a chart of the SMOEC level from January 1965 through March 2021.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5m8y7kzyhwo61.png?width=905&format=png&auto=webp&s=1073a6fa09e9b1151a162b79172d673af515fc93\n\nI want to bring your attention to the blue long-term trendline for SMOEC, and how it can be used to help indicate when investing in silver is likely a good idea. Essentially, when growth in money supply is faster than growth of the economy, AND silver has been underinvested in as an asset class long enough, the SMOEC alarm is triggered as it hits this blue line.\n\nSince 1965, SMOEC has only touched this trendline three times.\n\nThe first occurrence was in October 1971, where SMOEC bottomed at 0.79 and proceeded to increase 3.41 points over the next eight years to peak at 4.20 in February of 1980 (literally 420, I told you it was a sign silver was about to get high). Silver rose from $1.31 to $36.13, or a 2,658% gain using the end of month values (the daily close trough to peak was even greater). Over this same period, the S&P 500 returned only 67% with dividends reinvested. Silver, a metal with no cash flows, outperformed equities by a multiple of 40x over this period of 8.5 years (neither return is adjusted for inflation). This is partially due to the fact that the Hunt Brothers took delivery of so many contracts that it caused a short squeeze on top of the fundamentals-based rally.\n\nThe second time the SMOEC alarm was triggered was when SMOEC dropped to a ratio of 2.10 in November of 2001 and proceeded to increase 2.32 points over the next decade to peak at 4.42 in April of 2011. Silver rose from $4.14 to $48.60, an increase of over 1000%, and this was during a ‚Äòlost decade‚Äô for equities. The S&P 500 with dividends reinvested, returned only 41% in this 9.5-year period. Silver outperformed equities by a multiple of 24x (neither figure adjusted for inflation). There was no short squeeze involved in this bull market.\n\nOver the long term, it would be expected that cash flow producing assets would outperform silver, but over specific 8-10 year periods of time, silver can outperform other asset classes by many multiples. And in a true hyperinflationary environment where currency collapse is occurring, silver drastically outperforms. Just look at the Venezuelan stock market during their recent currency collapse. Investors received gains in the millions of percentage points, but in real terms (inflation adjusted) they actually lost 94%. This is an example of a situation where silver would be a far better asset to own than equities.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ir5gcfv0iwo61.png?width=676&format=png&auto=webp&s=7e02b95d63beea8de9b7e067cc40655d7a59da16\n\nI in no way think this is coming to the United States. I do think inflation will rise, and the value of the dollar will fall, but it will be nothing even close to a currency collapse. Fortunately for silver investors, a currency collapse isn‚Äôt necessary for silver to outperform equity returns by over 10x during the next decade.\n\nBack to SMOEC though:\n\nThe third time the SMOEC alarm was triggered was very recently in April of 2020 when it hit a level of 2.91. Silver was priced at $14.96, at a time the money supply was and still is increasing at a historically high rate, combined with the previous decade‚Äôs massive underinvestment in Silver (coming off of the 2011 highs). Starting in April 2020, silver has since risen to a SMOEC level of 3.37 as of March 2021. Silver is 0.46 points into a rally that I think could mirror the 1970s and push silver‚Äôs SMOEC level up by over 3.4 points once again.\n\nRemember that this indicator is on a LN scale, where each point is actually an exponential increase in the price of silver. Here is a chart to help you mentally digest what the price of silver would be at various SMOEC level and M3/GDP combinations. (LN scale because silver is nature‚Äôs money, so it just felt right)\n\nThe yellow highlighted box is where silver was in April of 2020 and the blue highlighted box is close to where it is as of March 2021.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/af5yjg13iwo61.png?width=644&format=png&auto=webp&s=f34ac3ae181c742c4ab2dbf30f64ae82648d84ac\n\n**An increase of 3.4 points from the bottom in in April of 2020 would mean a silver price of over $500 an ounce before this decade is out. And there‚Äôs really no reason it must stop there.**\n\nThe recent money supply growth has been extreme, and as the US government continues to implement modern monetary policy with massive debt driven deficits, it is expected that monetary expansion will continue. This is why bonds and have been selling off recently, and why yields are soaring. Long term treasuries just experienced their first bear market since 1980 (a drop of 20% or more). The 40-year bull market bond streak just ended. What was the situation like the last time bonds had a bear market? Massively higher inflation and precious metals prices.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0e9ncqp4iwo61.png?width=864&format=png&auto=webp&s=21a08435c70609ca534ca672815cc2095358ef5a\n\nThis inflation expectation is showing up in surging breakeven inflation rates. And this trend is showing very little sign of letting up, just look at the 5-year expected inflation rate:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/esd1tzp5iwo61.png?width=618&format=png&auto=webp&s=5c26a1673a48f884c3e3cba23ef3d393cfc5eac9\n\nInflation expectations are rising because we are actually starting to put money into the hands of real people rather than simply adding to bank reserves through QE. Stimulus checks, higher unemployment benefits, child tax credit expansion, PPP grants, deferral of loan payments, and likely some outright debt forgiveness soon as well. Whether or not you agree with these programs is irrelevant. They are not funded by increased taxes, they are funded through debt and money creation financed by the fed. As structural unemployment remains high (low unemployment is a fed mandate), I don‚Äôt see these programs letting up, and in fact I would be betting that further social safety net expansion is on the way. The $1.9 trillion bill was just passed, and it‚Äôs rumored the upcoming ‚Äòinfrastructure‚Äô bill is going to be between $3-4 trillion.\n\nThis is the trap that the fed finds itself in. Inflation expectations are pushing yields higher, but the nation‚Äôs debt levels (public and private) have expanded so much that raising rates would crush the nation fiscally through higher interest payments. Raising rates would also likely increase unemployment in the short run, during a time that unemployment is already high. So they won‚Äôt raise rates to stop inflation because the costs of doing so are more unpalatable than the inflation itself. They will keep short term rates at 0%, and begin to implement yield curve control where they put a cap on long term yields (as was done in the 1940s, the only other time debt levels were this high). So where does the air come out of this bubble, if the fed can‚Äôt raise rates at a time of expanding inflation? The value of the dollar. We will see a much lower dollar in terms of the goods it can buy, and likely in terms of other currencies as well (depending on how much money creation they perform).\n\nThe other problem with the fed‚Äôs policy of keeping rates low for extended durations of time (like has been the case since 2008), is that it actually breeds higher structural unemployment. In the short term, unemployment is impacted by interest rate shifts, but in the longer-term lower interest rates decrease the number of jobs available. Every company would like to fire as many people as possible to cut costs, and when they brag about creating jobs, know that the decision was never about jobs, but rather that jobs are a byproduct of expansion and are used as a bargaining chip to secure favorable tax credits and subsidies. Recently, the best way to get rid of workers is through automation.\n\nRobotics and AI are advancing rapidly and can increasingly be used to completely replace workers. The debate every company has is whether its worth paying a worker $40k every year or buying a robot that costs $200k up front and $5k a year to do that job. The reason they would buy the robot is because after so many years, there comes a point where the company will have saved money by doing so, because it is only paying $5k a year in up-keep versus $40k a year in salary and benefits. The cost of buying the robot is that it likely requires financing to pay that high of a price up front. In this situation, at 10% interest rates, the breakeven point for buying the robot versus employing a human is roughly 8 years. At 2% interest rates though, the breakeven investment timeline for purchasing the robot is only 4 years.\n\nThe business environment is uncertain, and deciding to purchase a robot with the thought that it will pay off starting 8 years from now is much riskier than making a decision that will pay off starting only 4 years from now. This trade off between employing people versus robots and AI is only becoming clearer too. Inflation puts natural upward pressure on wages, governments are mandating higher minimum wages are costlier benefits as well. There‚Äôs also the rising cost of healthcare that employers provide as well. Meanwhile the costs of robotics and AI are plummeting. The equation is tipped evermore towards capital versus labor, and the fed exacerbates this trend by ensuring the cost of capital is as low as possible via low interest rates.\n\nOn top of the automation trend, low interest rates drive mergers and acquisitions which also drive higher structural unemployment. In an industry with 3 competitors, the trend for the last 40 years has been for one massive corporation to simply purchase its competitor and fire half the workers (you don‚Äôt need 2 accounting departments after all). How can one $50 billion corporation afford to borrow $45 billion to purchase its massive competitor? Because long term low interest rates allow it to borrow the money in a way that the interest payments are affordable. Lacking competitive pressures, the industry now stagnates in terms of innovation which hurts long term growth in both wages and employment. Of course, our absolutely spineless anti-trust enforcement is partially to blame for this issue as well.\n\nThe fed is keeping interest rates low over long periods of time to help fix unemployment, when in reality low interest rates exacerbate unemployment and income inequality (execs get higher pay when they do layoffs and when they acquire competitors). **The fed‚Äôs solution to the problem is contributing to making the problem larger, and they‚Äôll keep giving us more of the solution until the problem is fixed.** And as structural unemployment continues, universal basic income and other social safety net policies will expand, funded by debt. Excess debt then further encourages the fed to keep interest rates low, because who wants to cut off benefits to people in need? And then low long term interest rates create more unemployment and more need for the safety nets. It‚Äôs a vicious cycle, but one that is extremely positive for the price of precious metals, especially silver.\n\nAnd guess what expensive robotics, electric vehicles, satellites, rockets, medical imaging tech, solar panels, and a bevy of other fast-growing technologies utilize as an input? Silver. Silver‚Äôs industrial demand is driven by the fact that compared to other elements it is the best conductor of electricity, its highly reflective, and it extremely durable. So, encouraging more capital investment in these industries via green government mandates and via low interest rates only drives demand for silver further.\n\nOne might wonder how with high unemployment we can actually get inflation. Well government is more than replacing lost income so far, just take a look at how disposable income has trended during this time of high unemployment. It‚Äôs also notable that all of the political momentum is in the direction of increasing incomes through government programs even further.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mnfd5gr7iwo61.png?width=864&format=png&auto=webp&s=34c7b3ddfc9808b29e08bd7619d47d1f51f840fc\n\nThe spark of inflation is what ignites rallies in precious metals like silver, and these rallies typically extend far beyond what the inflation rates would justify on their own. This is because precious metals are insurance against fiat collapse. People don‚Äôt worry about fiat insurance when inflation is low, but when inflation rises it becomes very relevant at a time that there isn‚Äôt much capacity to satisfy the surge in demand for this insurance. Sure, inflation might only peak at 5% or 10% and while silver rises 100%, but if things spiral out of control its worth paying for silver even after a big rally, because the equities you hold aren‚Äôt going to be worth much in real terms if the wheels truly came off the wagon. The Venezuela example proves that fact, but even during the 1970s equities had negative real rates of return and the US never had hyperinflation, just high inflation.\n\nDuring these times of higher inflation, holders of PMs aren‚Äôt necessarily expecting a fiat collapse, they just want 1%, 5%, or even 10% of their portfolio to be allocated to holding gold and silver as a hedge. During the 40-year bond bull market of decreasing inflation this portfolio allocation to precious metals lost favor, and virtually no one has it any longer. I can guarantee most people don‚Äôt even have the options of buying gold or silver in their 401ks, let alone actually owning any. A move back into having even a small precious metals allocation is what drives silver up by 30x or more.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TLDR: SLV is a scam, as are basically all of the silver ETFs.**\n\nIf you do want to buy silver you'll buy physical when premiums are low, or PSLV.\n\nDisclaimer: I am a random guy on the internet and this entire post should be regarded as my personal opinion","created_utc":"2021-03-24 00:10:34","num_comments":2077,"score":22063,"upvote_ratio":0.96,"is_original_content":false,"permalink":"/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mbx510/slv_is_a_complete_scam_its_a_scalp_trade_set_up/","title":"SLV is a complete scam, its a scalp trade set up by banks to screw over investors.

However, there would be no chance of dilution had the stock not been able to stay above $18. Meaning if the stock wasn‚Äôt performing well, it wouldn‚Äôt be diluted.

Turns out you can actually search the SEC's vast archive of 10-K filings for specific phrases. Let's see just how common this language is, shall we? First, the actual excerpt from the 10K filing in its entirety:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>**The market price of our Class A Common Stock has been extremely volatile and may continue to be volatile due to numerous circumstances beyond our control.**  \n>  \n>Stock markets in general and our stock price in particular have recently experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies and our company. For example, on January 28, 2021, our Class A Common Stock experienced an intra-day trading high of $483.00 per share and a low of $112.25 per share. In addition, from January 11, 2021 to March 17, 2021, the closing price of our Class A Common Stock on the NYSE ranged from as low as $19.94 to as high as $347.51 and daily trading volume ranged from approximately 7,060,000 to 197,200,000 shares. During this time, we have not experienced any material changes in our financial condition or results of operations that would explain such price volatility or trading volume. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our Class A Common Stock. In particular, a large proportion of our Class A Common Stock has been and may continue to be traded by short sellers which has put and may continue to put pressure on the supply and demand for our Class A Common Stock, further influencing volatility in its market price. Additionally, these and other external factors have caused and may continue to cause the market price and demand for our Class A Common Stock to fluctuate substantially, which may limit or prevent our stockholders from readily selling their shares of our common stock and may otherwise negatively affect the liquidity of our Class A Common Stock.  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>**A ‚Äúshort squeeze‚Äù due to a sudden increase in demand for shares of our Class A Common Stock that largely exceeds supply has led to, and may continue to lead to, extreme price volatility in shares of our Class A Common Stock.**  \n>  \n>Investors may purchase shares of our Class A Common Stock to hedge existing exposure or to speculate on the price of our Class A Common Stock. Speculation on the price of our Class A Common Stock may involve long and short exposures. To the extent aggregate short exposure exceeds the number of shares of our Class A Common Stock available for purchase on the open market, investors with short exposure may have to pay a premium to repurchase shares of our Class A Common Stock for delivery to lenders of our Class A Common Stock. Those repurchases may in turn, dramatically increase the price of shares of our Class A Common Stock until additional shares of our Class A Common Stock are available for trading or borrowing. This is often referred to as a ‚Äúshort squeeze.‚ÄùA large proportion of our Class A Common Stock has been and may continue to be traded by short sellers which may increase the likelihood that our Class A Common Stock will be the target of a short squeeze. A short squeeze has led and could continue to lead to volatile price movements in shares of our Class A Common Stock that are unrelated or disproportionate to our operating performance or prospects and, once investors purchase the shares of our Class A Common Stock necessary to cover their short positions, the price of our Class A Common Stock may rapidly decline. Stockholders that purchase shares of our Class A Common Stock during a short squeeze may lose a significant portion of their investment.  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>**Future sales of a substantial amount of our Class A Common Stock in the public markets by our insiders, or the perception that these sales may occur, may cause the market price of our Class A Common Stock to decline.**  \n>  \n>Our employees, directors and officers, and their affiliates, hold substantial amounts of shares of our Class A Common Stock. Sales of a substantial number of such shares by these stockholders, or the perception that such sales will occur, may cause the market price of our Class A Common Stock to decline.

{"_id":{"$oid":"605bb2f25df7eedfb49c1d41"},"id":"mbsicz","fullname":"t3_mbsicz","selftext":"Per the title, I'm seeing a lot of confusion regarding what an at-the-market (\"ATM\") offering entails, and what the consequences of such an offering would be. Lots of GME apes are seeing the following language (from the 10-K) and are confused/scared:\n\n*In December 2020, we entered into the ATM Program. Sales of our Class A Common Stock under the ATM Program may be made by means of transactions that are deemed to be an \"at the market offering\" as defined in Rule 415(a)(4) under the Securities Act, including block transactions, sales made directly on the NYSE or sales made into any other existing trading markets of our shares of Class A Common Stock.*¬†\n\nApes are worried the share price will decline, etc., so I thought I'd do a (relatively) brief post to provide some info and hopefully calm some fears. **TLDR at the bottom.**\n\n**First, what is an ATM offering?**\n\nIn a sentence, an ATM offering is an offering where the Company issues securities over time directly into an existing trading market at the market price.\n\n**Why do Companies conduct ATM offerings?**\n\nFor $$$. Basically, it gives companies the opportunity to raise measured amounts of equity capital over time by allowing a company to tap into the existing secondary market for its shares on an as-and-when-needed basis.¬†\n\n**How are ATM offerings unique from traditional underwritten follow-on offerings?**\n\nIn contrast to traditional underwritten offerings, where a Company issues a fixed # of shares at a fixed price, all at once, in an ATM offering, the Company retains control over the timing and size of each sale.\n\nSales of the Company‚Äôs shares, which can be newly issued ‚Äúprimary‚Äù shares and/or ‚Äúsecondary‚Äù shares held by existing security holders, are made through one or more registered broker-dealers who act as agents on the issuer‚Äôs behalf.\n\n**What are the advantages of an ATM offering?**\n\n**Minimal market impact.**\n\nThis is likely the *MOST IMPORTANT* advantage for us apes\n\nBecause in an ATM offering program, the securities are sold in small batches over time, the Company can incrementally sell shares into the natural trading flow of the market, without having to market and/or announce the offering. As a result, shares are able to ‚Äútrickle‚Äù into the market, limiting the impact on the issuer‚Äôs stock price. Additionally, investors cannot short the issuer‚Äôs stock in advance of the offering since the timing of any particular sale is not known.\n\n**Flexibility.**\n\nThe timing and size of an ATM offering are at the Company‚Äôs discretion, which means the Company can match its capital structure to its ongoing needs. For example, the Company can implement a limit price below which sales will not occur and/or a percentage limitation on daily sales to reduce downward price pressure on its stock, as well as dilution.\n\n**Low Cost.**\n\nThe distribution costs for ATM offerings typically are less than for traditional follow-on offerings, and the absence of a company commitment to sell means that there will be no sales below acceptable share prices.\n\n**What are the disadvantages of an ATM offering?**\n\nThe main disadvantage is that because ATM offerings tend to be substantially smaller than traditional follow-on offerings, they aren‚Äôt as useful to companies trying to raise a large amount of capital.\n\nThis disadvantage doesn‚Äôt really impact GME nor does it impact us stockholders. In fact, we could read this as a positive in that GME isn‚Äôt trying to raise a ton of money right now because they don‚Äôt need it!\n\n**TLDR**: Don‚Äôt freak out over the fact that GME adopted an ATM program allowing the Company to issue more shares. An ATM Offering is a much more favorable alternative to a traditional underwritten offering and in reality doesn‚Äôt impact stock prices in any significant way. If anything, the fact that GME would choose an ATM offering over any other type could mean they‚Äôre thinking about us apes ;)\n\n**TLDR to TLDR**: HODL üíéüôå\n\n**Disclaimer**: This is a very scaled-down overview of how ATM offerings work. Do your own research if you‚Äôd like to learn more ‚Äì there are a lot of memos and articles out there with good information.  Also feel free to comment/PM me if you want to correct and/or supplement this post with more info.\n\n**Edit**: Thought I should post my position - holding 88 shares @ average of $97.29.\n\n**Edit 2**: Thought people would read the blurb above taken from the 10-K, which states that the company initiated the ATM offering program in **December 2020**, but it looks like they're not so I wanted to highlight that here. This means the option to have an ATM offering has been around since LAST YEAR. They didn't initiate when the stock price was rocketing up to $400+ and frankly, there's nothing to indicate that they plan on conducting an ATM offering any time soon. See below from the Liquidity & Capital Resources section of their 10-K to help calm your smooth brains some more:\n\n*Based on our current operating plans, we believe that available cash balances, cash generated from our operating activities and net availability under our revolving credit facility will provide sufficient liquidity to fund our operations for the next 12 months as well as the foreseeable future.*","created_utc":"2021-03-23 20:00:05","num_comments":114,"score":650,"upvote_ratio":0.94,"is_original_content":false,"permalink":"/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mbsicz/description_of_atm_offerings_for_confused_gme_apes/","title":"Description of ATM Offerings for confused GME apes","author":"e5dn10","firstseen":"2021-03-24 21:45:22.226416"}

This Form 8-K also disclosed that, pursuant to the Agreement, we agreed that effective at our 2021 annual meeting of stockholders (the ‚Äú2021 Annual Meeting‚Äù), the size of the Board would be reduced from the current 13 directors to nine directors and that the Board would nominate for election the individuals identified in the Form 8-K for election as directors at the 2021 Annual Meeting. **As of the date of this Form 10-K, the Board has not determined the definitive slate of nominees but currently expects that the following incumbent directors will retire from the Board at the 2021 Annual Meeting: Lizabeth Dunn, Paul Evans, Raul J. Fernandez, Reginald Fils-Aim√©, William Simon, James K. Symancyk, Carrie W. Teffner and Kathy P. Vrabeck.** The contemplated retirements are not because of a disagreement with us on any matter relating to our operations, policies or practices.\n\n\n**This change would leave only George Sherman and Kurt Wolf remaining from who was on the board prior to the deal with RC Ventures.**\n\n\n*This indicates four more board members than previously announced are planning on leaving. Additionally, a little further down there is a caveat under the description of the formation of the Strategic Committee that indicates additional senior executive changes may be in the cards:*\n\n\n>Our Board of Directors has formed a committee of directors called the ‚ÄúStrategic Planning and Capital Allocation Committee‚Äù (the Strategic Committee). The Committee is responsible for assisting the Board in its oversight of our operational objectives and corporate strategy, capital allocation priorities and other opportunities for maximizing stockholder value. Our Board, through the Strategic Committee, is currently evaluating our executive leadership team skill sets related to meeting changing business requirements and has engaged a third party firm to assist it in its evaluation and exploration. **This evaluation and exploration could result in a change in one or more of our senior executives.**\n\n\n\n\n\n*******\n`````Updated since some incorrectly believe this is old news`````\n\nHere is the [original section of the 8K filed for the agreement with RC Ventures Jan 11](https://news.gamestop.com/node/18396/html) that shows the four additional names listed as leaving today were at that time expected to stand for re-election:\n\n\n>Pursuant to the Agreement, the Company has agreed to increase the size of its board of directors (the ‚ÄúBoard‚Äù) by three directors to a total of 13 directors and appoint Alain (Alan) Attal, Ryan Cohen and James (Jim) Grube (the ‚ÄúNew Directors‚Äù) as members of the Board, each with a term expiring at the Company‚Äôs 2021 annual meeting of stockholders (the ‚Äú2021 Annual Meeting‚Äù). The Company has further agreed that, effective at the 2021 Annual Meeting, the size of the Board will be reduced by four directors to a total of nine directors. The Board will nominate each of the New Directors (or their replacements appointed in accordance with the terms of the Agreement) and **current directors Paul Evans, Reginald Fils-Aim√©, George Sherman, William Simon, Carrie Teffner and Kurt Wolf for election as directors at the 2021 Annual Meeting.**\n\n********\nEdit 2:\nJust spotted another minor change from the same section of the 10-K:\n\nThe previous CFO is out as of tomorrow, not the 26th, with the previously mentioned interim CFO picking up his duties until a replacement is announced. Not really new info, just moved the timeframe up 2 days. I wonder if this means there will be a new CFO announcement sooner because his end date moved up, or if it means they are still searching and the interim will be in place for a while.\n\n>Mr. Bell‚Äôs cessation as our Chief Financial Officer and Ms. Saadeh-Jajeh‚Äôs assumption of the role of interim Chief Financial Officer will occur on March 24, 2021\n\n********\nEdit 3:\nOne last edit because I'm seeing a lot of articles coming out in the media where they lean heavily on the fact that Gamestop retains the ability to issue shares:\n\nFrom [page 29 of today's 10-K filing](https://news.gamestop.com/node/18661/html), under \n\n**Liquidity and Capital Resources**\n\n\n>Based on our current operating plans, we believe that available cash balances, cash generated from our operating activities and net availability under our revolving credit facility **will provide sufficient liquidity to fund our operations for the next 12 months as well as the foreseeable future.**\n\n\nYes, the company retains the option to make an ATM share offering, but they are plainly stating that as it stands right now they don't need to do so to raise capital to meet their plans.","created_utc":"2021-03-23 18:43:38","num_comments":224,"score":3768,"upvote_ratio":0.97,"is_original_content":false,"permalink":"/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mbqxm9/gme_4_additional_board_members_expected_to_leave/","title":"GME: 4 Additional Board Members Expected to leave in June.

Aside from the financial results, we see the board appointments and Jenna Owens ([https://www.linkedin.com/in/jenna-owens/?trk=public\\_profile\\_browsemap\\_mini-profile\\_title](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jenna-owens/?trk=public_profile_browsemap_mini-profile_title)) as Chief Operating Officer. It doesn't specify who the all important Chief Tech Officer will be, but other sources confirm Matt Francis ([https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattfrancis/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattfrancis/)). They've massively reduced short-term debt, however this quarter has not seen a change it seems in long term debt.\n\nOne thing I thought was really cool that isn't mentioned in the report is the introduction of a larger selection of gaming peripherals (chairs, keyboards, desks) into their product lineup. The CEO mentioned this and I think it's important, that they want to escape the cyclical 'console release-based' model they've functioned under in order to take in more consistent customer flow. Twitch is growing MASSIVELY, and will continue to grow as more and more people are pulled into the incredibly lucrative platform. This growth will push sales of VR gear, keyboards, mice, monitors, and desks. All of these products will be prime product categories for GME in the near and long term.\n\nOne other thing that was emphasized was increased efficiency in logistics and order fulfillment. I assume this is a callback to the recent struggle with next-gen console supply. I think the appointment of both a Chief Tech Officer and Chief Operating Officer who worked previously with Amazon is a clear signal that they're pushing heavily to dominate the e-commerce gaming space and massively cut down on inefficiencies in their fulfillment pipeline.\n\nAltogether, in my opinion these administrative changes along with the clearly healthy financial condition of the company give it a solid foundation to build up their online platform and offer better deals to customers in order to remain truly competitive in the market.","created_utc":"2021-03-23 18:03:52","num_comments":12,"score":111,"upvote_ratio":0.82,"is_original_content":false,"permalink":"/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mbq2yu/gme_quarterly_results_20192020/","title":"$GME Quarterly Results 2019-2020","author":"Plagrea","firstseen":"2021-03-24 21:45:22.231790"}

GameStop for the long run\n2) the gaming industry is growing on a compound annual growth rate of 11% and no one is positioned to take over that market like GameStop now with all their existing members and experience in the industry\n3) e-commerce sales of GameStop accounts for 32% of all sales in just a year.

But take a step back and take a look at the bigger picture. We have formed a very nice ascending channel since Feb. 5 and have tested the bottom at least 5 times. Today we reached the bottom, and the chart is already showing signs of a bounce. We are looking to hold $10.50 support (bottom of the channel) and failing that, we have VERY strong support at $10. We‚Äôll see at open tomorrow but it will take considerable sell or short pressure to push it down by more than 5%.. We may have lost some ground but we have solid support at the $10.00 price. Retards, this shit is about to pull out the UNO reverse card and make the hedgies sweat. If you already paperhanded AMC/GME...fuck you....but now is your chance to jump back on the rocketüöÄ\n\nWith GME news about to flood the media, I would expect a nice green day tomorrow. Have faith APES. The squeeze isn't happening this week, but we are building up to it. I have the first two weeks of April marked on my calendar for the squeeze. Although, only the Hedge funds have an idea of when it will happen. Right now they are trying to bluff you off the rocket so HODL. ü¶ç\n\nIf I was to compare it to January, I would say this looks similar to January 26th. Take a look at the MACD and RSI. Do you see what I see? See how much room we are giving ourselves to run? This shit is about to get wild!\n\nEdit: added some rockets and thanks for the award!

{"_id":{"$oid":"605bb2f25df7eedfb49c1d61"},"id":"mbnsrs","fullname":"t3_mbnsrs","selftext":"**JFROG** is in a spot that you rarely ever see: a spot where the market doesn't quite understand what they do. You get the chance to capitalize by understanding.\n\nThis is my first real DD post, so I would appreciate feedback and criticism here. I think this company is massively overlooked, and here is why:\n\n**What they do:**\n\nTheir main product is **JFrog Artifactory**, a universal repository for software binaries (executable code). It also serves as a mirror repository - it stores local copies of Open Source Software. They also offer **JFrog Xray**, which scans those Open Source libraries for malware/vulnerabilities. **JFrog Pipelines** then puts the pieces together, automating the \"building\" of the software. And the last piece is **JFrog Distribution,** which packages up the finished software package and delivers it to its destination (a piece of hardware, like your car, phone, watch, computer).\n\nAs a metaphor, let's use a pizza restaurant. Artifactory is the walk-in fridge, Xray is the health inspector, Pipelines is the chef, and Distribution is the delivery driver. They all work together seamlessly so that you can get your pizza.\n\n**How this ties in with the huge Autonomous Driving market:**\n\nJFrog already has partnerships with all of the big players in autonomous driving -- Tesla, Lucid, BMW, Daimler, Toyota Motors, etc. They actually have an Automotive DevOps conference every year ([https://summit.jfrog.com/automotive-devops/](https://summit.jfrog.com/automotive-devops/)). **JFrog is the sole reason** that you no longer have to turn your car off to apply an update, it's just done automatically over the air.\n\nI'm going to fit the earlier framework into the framework of Autonomous Driving-\n\n* Developers want to improve the function of their vehicles, so they write fresh new code or pull in a new open-source software package\n* The fresh code they write, along with the open-source packages is stored in Artifactory\n* The code and open-source packages pulled in need to be scanned for vulnerabilities - this is done with JFrog Xray\n* The open-source parts and the fresh written parts need to be combined into a program and tested for errors - this is done with JFrog Pipelines\n* The code then needs to be delivered over-the-air to the vehicles, seamlessly - this is done with JFrog Distribution\n\nAs the autonomous driving industry grows to over 3 trillion by 2025, this specific use case is going to **explode.**\n\n**Other big growth catalysts:**\n\nYou may have heard of the Solarwinds and FireEye data hacks/leaks, described as a ‚Äúsupply chain vulnerability‚Äù attack or \"dependency confusion\". The toolset JFrog offers is the best thing on the market to combat this kind of threat, and will stand to benefit from the need to increase cyber security. **JFrog's Xray tool won the DevSecOps solution of the year award in 2020** ([https://devopsdozen.com/](https://devopsdozen.com/)), beating out all the tools available on the market by a significant margin. Analyst firm **GigaOm** also placed JFrog Xray as the best tool available, beating out other options from Gitlab and Micro Focus.\n\nWith each one of these huge leaks -- CapitalOne, Equifax, etc -- the development industry sees another huge shift towards security, and JFrog is positioned to scoop up all of this business. Side note: CapitalOne always presents at JFrog conferences now, and they're a huge champion for JFrog now that they're using JFrog's solution to plug their security holes.\n\n**Company Background**\n\nFounded in 2008, when they launched Artifactory. There is only one direct competitor with similar scope - Sonatype Nexus. Artifactory is both better and cheaper. Sonatype began as a plugin for Artifactory that worked similarly to Xray before Xray was released -- when Sonatype tried to encroach on the \"Universal Repo\" market, JFrog struck back with the release of Xray and nearly killed Sonatype. Sonatype still exists, hanging on by a thread, passed around from one venture capital company to another.\n\nI've used both of these products over the years and have worked in environments with and without. I can say with conviction that Artifactory improves developer productivity significantly and secures company Intellectual Property.\n\nTheir product is used by 80%+ the Fortune 500 companies. This includes **Apple, Twitter, Tesla, Google, AWS, Microsoft, IBM, and Facebook.** These companies trust this product to keep their crown jewels (the software that runs their entire companies) safe. That should tell you something about how good it is. They have a renewal rate of over 90%, with 133% net revenue retention from existing customers **(FYI, this net retention rate is top 10 in the world among SaaS companies).**\n\nThey acquired Shippable in 2019 to turn it into JFrog Pipelines, and the CEO has said that they will be using the funds secured via the IPO to continue to do strategic acquisitions. Other acquisitions include Conan, Trainologic, and CloudMunch.\n\nThey went public in late 2020 but it was a bit overshadowed, considering they came out the same day as Snowflake.\n\n**Financials**\n\nComps here are based on the segment they operate in.\n\nDataDog (DDOG) is another development/delivery infrastructure tool mainly centered around performance monitoring which the teams that use JFrog would typically also use. \n\nCrowdstrike (CRWD) is another best in class cybersecurity company that comes into play as you are in operations protecting and detecting threats as your application is running.\n\nAtlassian (TEAM) makes Jira, Confluence, and Trello, which are used by most software teams for managing development requirements and agile dev team collaboration. They're not exactly a comparable solution, but I view them as a developer productivity tool that you need around the same time you start needing Artifactory. \n\n* Net Dollar Retention\n   * **FROG: 139%**\n   * DDOG: 130%\n   * CRWD: 125%\n   * TEAM: 132%\n* GAAP Earnings: As a high-growth software company, it's not surprising that their GAAP earnings are negative. What is surprising is that they're very close to profitability, and even had a quarter of profitability last year.\n   * **FROG: -$0.1861**\n   * DDOG: -$0.05\n   * CRWD: -$0.4763\n   * TEAM: -$4.9355\n* Market cap:\n   * **FROG: $4.9 B**\n   * DDOG: $26.3 B\n   * CRWD: $47.8 B\n   * TEAM: $59.4 B\n* Forward P/E Ratio\n   * **FROG: 615**\n   * DDOG: 666\n   * CRWD: 771\n   * TEAM: 173\n* No long term debt\n* Their current ratio (short term assets/short term debt) is 5.3\n* GAAP Margin is 81%\n* Revenue growing 44% YOY, will probably accelerate with acquisitions\n\n**Ownership**\n\n65% owned by insiders and institutions. Most of that ownership is insiders -- there are only 5 ETFs (including an ARK Fund, IZRL) that own it. ARK just bought another huge block of shares a few days ago. Their final lockup release was 03/15 and there weren't really any huge sales, insider ownership has stayed pretty much the same.\n\n**Summary**\n\nJFrog has a great product, and they are uniquely positioned to corner a growing market (that they invented) which has high barriers to entry. They have proven to be forward-thinking and have fantastic financials.\n\n**Positions**\n\n400 shares,100 LEAPS. Froggy leaps.

Now, most people claim technical analysis is bullshit, [\"tea leaf reading for the financial community\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mayfta/elliot_wave_theory_an_introduction_part_1/grwq98u?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and [\"astrology for men\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mayfta/elliot_wave_theory_an_introduction_part_1/grwpnwl?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). But I assure you it is more than that. It is useful. I trade almost solely off of technical analysis, to great success. My favourite way to trade is based off of support and resistance, RSI, Moving Averages and then the basic chart patterns. The chart patterns in this post make up about 80% of all the patterns I trade.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x3cnouyxvto61.png?width=581&format=png&auto=webp&s=d535d296efbeaa5ae09ff0230474e72bcdd84cf1\n\n**Double tops and bottoms:**\n\n* Double tops and double bottoms are reversal formations, signaling to chartists that a sustained trend may be about to reverse\n* Double tops typically occur when two successive moves higher are sold into, creating two peaks on the chart. The low point between these two highs is known as the \"neckline\", and the pattern culminates with a break through this level\n* On this occasion you see that a second top fails to break above the initial high. This indicates that the uptrend may have finished  and a reversal is likely. It's sensible to enter your trade below/below (depending on whether its a top or bottom), when the pattern is fully formed (because another pattern may be forming, such as a triple top)\n* The benefit of trading a pattern such as a double top is that it also gives you a price target. The difference in price is likely to be equal to the difference from the neckline to the highest/lowest peak \n* Double bottoms are the same as double tops, only inverted. They signal bullish reversals\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Double top](https://preview.redd.it/sf0uh2d4wto61.png?width=970&format=png&auto=webp&s=0433ebf55464f6e17bce21ec063eccfc4d207198)\n\n**Triple Tops and Bottoms**\n\n* The same as double tops and bottoms, except the market hits support/resistance three times before reversing\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Triple top on Spy](https://preview.redd.it/whzgb80awto61.png?width=584&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc6507d89616e996b98250a3e2d4779fdb33ff17)\n\n**Head and Shoulders**\n\n* This is another pattern signaling a trend reversal. Ver similar to triple tops, but this time you get a peak (left shoulder), followed by a higher peak (head), followed by a lower peak (right shoulder)\n* The neckline is formed between the two troughs on either side of the head. If the neckline's sloping down that's an even better indication of a reversal\n* You calculate target price based on the distance between the head and the neckline - just add/subtract that distance to/from the breakout point\n* It is worth noting that a head and shoulder's patter is only complete once the neckline is broken\n* Inverse head and shoulders work the same, only in the other direction\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Inverse head and shoulders on Spy](https://preview.redd.it/jy5prbvmwto61.png?width=749&format=png&auto=webp&s=d015b7bd3de4605e39d20fa1f9ab836b55c6cd07)\n\n**Triangles**\n\nI already covered triangles from an Elliot Wave perspective in my series on Elliot Wave Theory (linked at the top of this post). So this is just going to be a quick summary on triangles\n\n*Ascending Triangles*\n\n* Forms as the market hits a strong level of horizontal resistance, but a series of higher lows indicate that the market is converging towards it\n* This pattern usually signals that the price will move higher but its possible that the resistance level might be too strong, causing the price to bounce off \n* Generally, the best strategy is to trade the breakout\n* There is usually a re-test of the horizontal resistance level after the break, to establish it as a new support level. The conservative trader could wait for the backtest before entering\n\n*Descending Triangles*\n\n* Works in the opposite way to ascending triangles\n* The market hits a level of support, but a series of successively lower peaks suggests the price will move lower\n\n*Symmetrical Triangle*\n\n* Occurs when the price appears to be converging with a series of lower peaks and higher troughs (lows). This is a continuation pattern, which means the market will usually continue in the same direction as the overall trend after the pattern has formed\n* If theres no clear trend before the triangle, the breakout is equally likely to be up or down. Its possible to trade this scenario with a \"one cancels the other\" market order. Place an order to buy above and sell below the triangle, and if one gets triggered, the other gets cancelled.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Symmetrical Triangle on Copper - happening right now](https://preview.redd.it/djbyzgevwto61.png?width=1443&format=png&auto=webp&s=194484ed17683bc6b6247e604335bd87808aa341)\n\n**Rectangles**\n\n* Similar to symmetrical triangles, these are continuation patterns that mark consolidation in the current trend before a continued move\n* After a strong move, the market will usually consolidate a while, establishing a clear rectangle formed between support and resistances. This is essentially to establish a sustainable trend and to give people time to mentally accept that the new higher/lower price is a reasonable price, before pushing them to new prices again\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Rectangle](https://preview.redd.it/0egvhfr8xto61.png?width=737&format=png&auto=webp&s=0fe6190a88f23f684f34e534397ea8c643afcb0c)\n\n**Wedges**\n\nNot to be confused with triangles, these patterns are formed when the price of a market begins to narrow into a tight range between two sloping trend lines\n\n*Rising Wedge*\n\n* Occurs between two upwardly sloping  lines of support and resistance. In this case the line of support is steeper than the resistance line\n* This pattern generally signals that price will push lower\n\n*Falling Wedge*\n\n* Occurs between two downwardly sloping levels. In this case, the line of resistance is steeper than the line of support, and usually signals that the price will move higher\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Falling wedges](https://preview.redd.it/6eyrpwkmxto61.png?width=1446&format=png&auto=webp&s=d09bca12c69bcbdb9aef96a82ac976a493967a3a)\n\nWith all chart patterns, its usually best to trade the breakouts. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMany thanks for reading, I hope it is of benefit to everyone.

Now the pandemic definitely hurt their numbers but according to market watch they‚Äôre still completely on track.\n\nTheir total debt actually shrunk last quarter from 41b to 34b, liabilities from 16b to 13b, and their total accounts receivable only shrunk by a small margin in comparison.\n\nThey charge clients on a per-mile-flown basis so these numbers tell me that even during the pandemic they were still resilient enough to make close to their average revenue. Their inventory continues to fluctuate at a healthy rate.\n\nThey laid off 1,400 employees in November of last year and just culled another 9,000 employees from their global workforce. These kinds of cuts can be good or bad. If their revenue was much much worse I would easily conclude the more likely scenario is they are failing and flailing, but with their revenue still on-par with pre covid returns, it seems highly possible that this is a smart practice of ‚Äútrimming the fat‚Äù from their corporation. Many jobs can be replaced with new online tools (SaaS) and other means of automation. I think Rolls Royce has finally realized this and is preparing for an overhaul on every level.\n\nWhile this company is not an airline, it is still the second largest turbofan manufacturer in the world rivaled only by GE. Pre-pandemic shares of $RYCEY were trading at $10+, now down to $1.50 despite Rolls Royce‚Äôs earnings not being as heavily impacted as some other companies like American Airlines, Boeing, and others we‚Äôve seen make a decent recovery from the pandemic‚Äôs toll. I feel like this stock is being neglected for multiple reasons, of which I‚Äôm sure some people wrongly think it‚Äôs associated to the company that makes $500,000 cars that not many people own.\n\nGlad to hear your opinions and I hope I‚Äôm missing something, if so - please let me know why people seem to hate this stock so much!","created_utc":"2021-03-23 15:30:30","num_comments":119,"score":108,"upvote_ratio":0.81,"is_original_content":false,"permalink":"/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mbmovt/why_is_rolls_royce_plc_so_undervalued/","title":"Why is Rolls Royce PLC so undervalued?","author":"Paradox68","firstseen":"2021-03-24 21:45:22.243034"}

{"_id":{"$oid":"605bb2f25df7eedfb49c1d72"},"id":"mbllal","fullname":"t3_mbllal","selftext":"For the last few weeks I have been following airline stocks quite closely. From what I have gathered, American Airlines is undervalued. I have multiple reasons why and will explain them below. What I am going to show you is why I like the stock.\n\nLets start with a comparison.\n\n[AAL\\_Comparison\\_03232021](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zjXuI8XNQC2D7xGnP-oAGfS0d4k7sFh0QMVgYa7aRUU/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nI comprised all similar airlines along with AAL into one spreadsheet, displaying their current value as of today, along with Market Cap, Income, and Sales. AAL is currently valued, according to these numbers, about 20 points lower than it should be. Of course though, this is just my opinion based on these numbers. Lets look at some more factual data.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAmerican Airlines is the largest passenger airline in the world, with roughly 1440 aircraft and 900 operational at any time. Because of this, American Airlines is in control of the passenger market. \n\n[Airline Wikipedia Data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_airlines_in_North_America)\n\nThis data shows up to 2020, which gives a good idea of what the pandemic has inflicted on this industry. Yes, numbers are low but we need to look at where we are headed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAccording to this data, we are looking at 85% vaccinated by Dec. In my opinion, the speed at which we are administering vaccines, I think May will be primed for at least 40% vaccinated. Most states are sitting at somewhere between 10-20% vaccinated. The US in total is 13.5% fully vaccinated, with 24.9% having at least received one dose. This wide of a spread between first and second doses, tells me that we are moving fast towards a majority vaccinated.\n\n[NPR Vaccination Visualization](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2021/01/28/960901166/how-is-the-covid-19-vaccination-campaign-going-in-your-state)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere is a lot of data about every country and its reopening plan. Link below will show an article with most countries plan to reopen. This data to me, is a bit more convoluted, and subject to change at any moment depending on new cases of the virus. From what I have gathered, some countries would rather be open for tourists, mainly Caribbean countries. Others, like large EU players, are staying shut for much longer. Less reliable data, but still data none the less. What it tells me, is that there is places to go if you want to fly. \n\n[Reopening Plans](https://thepointsguy.com/guide/reopening-soon-a-country-by-country-guide-to-coronavirus-recovery/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn a less positive note, American Airlines sentiment is low. \n\n[Forbes Top Airlines 2020](https://www.forbes.com/sites/christopherelliott/2020/05/04/the-best-and-worst-airlines-of-2020/?sh=72e8ed0e1a8e)\n\nAmerican Airlines is last on the list, and for many good reasons. A recent merger, and internal company issues has made this airline a difficult one to manage and project a good face. I believe with a bit of time, they will be back up higher on this list. Controlling the largest fleet of aircraft allows for some lee way when it comes to passenger complaints. From speaking to friends in different cities, I have found that American Airlines is sometimes the only way to go. This is not hard data. This is simply an understanding that with the largest fleet, comes the ability to set your own price and do things your way. If American Airlines is the only option, people will be forced to fly AA. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn my honest opinion, I see at least a 10 point gain if not more, from this stock. I like this stock and see it as an easy investment, with returns as early as may, as late as August.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDo your own DD before investing, as always. Again, I like the stock.\n\nDisclosure: I hold stock and calls in AAL.","created_utc":"2021-03-23 14:42:45","num_comments":32,"score":38,"upvote_ratio":0.74,"is_original_content":false,"permalink":"/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mbllal/long_on_aal/","title":"Long on AAL","author":"bolognasuntan11","firstseen":"2021-03-24 21:45:22.244528"}

I think most of us here can agree that something could certainly happen due to the insanely low volume we have been seeing as well as the Earnings Report coming later today. Here are some a few key indicators why GME can and will go up dramatically soon.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[1 Hour Technical Analysis](https://preview.redd.it/007anng09to61.jpg?width=1895&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=aff7be90f38ab719c4288d31a1ff33f04b32cd8f)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. **RSI -** The first point I'd like to touch on is RSI. As you can see, the RSI is extremely overbought in the bottom left of the chart when GME was making it's comeback from the drop to $40. Now look at the RSI **AT THE SAME PRICE** today and you'll see that we are heading towards being oversold. What does this mean? It's simply an indicator that we are oversold and due a huge price increase.\n\n2. **Trend -** In terms of the month, we have seen insane gains from the $40 price point we were sitting at for weeks. From the start of this chart to the end you can see an upward trend. Now if you look at the first pennant formation indicated by the white lines in the red highlighted area, it's starting to look awful familiar to the current correction we are seeing in the second red highlighted area. The current trend we are in is a Bullish Descending Triangle, much like the Pennant we saw earlier.\n\n3. **Volume -** With GME, when volume goes up, price goes up. If you look at the volume you can see that whenever it dries up, the price tends to skyrocket. Right now volume is extremely low, a sign that people are holding strong and shorters are having a difficult time dropping the price further.\n\n4. **Turning Point -** With the RSI, Trend, and Volume all pointing towards future rapid growth, I'm inclined to believe we will see massive gains soon. I do not see the price dropping below $150 at this point, and the only way I see it getting to that area is MASSIVE short selling to artificially drop the price.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Conclusion -** The technicals point toward GME skyrocketing in the near future. Take this all with a grain of salt though, the price could very well drop below the areas I've mentioned before going up. Above all else **HODL** and the tendies shall come!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**UPDATE - 3/23/2021 - 6:58 ET:** Looks like the price was driven down after a relatively good earnings report, can't say it was totally unexpected but it certainly threw many of us off. The price was starting to break upwards only to be violently thrown downwards. iborrowdesk shows that 50k shares were borrowed and likely contributed to this selling pressure. [https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)\n\nThe price did bounce off of $150 like previously mentioned after getting down to around 15-20 RSI. They're now in a very oversold territory, but it wouldn't surprise me if they kept trying to artificially lower the price. The shorts aren't going to give up so easily. So **HOOOOODLLLLL** fellow apes.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9z6b88q0zuo61.jpg?width=1921&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c87def75591da869bb65cf65a89bf055dd57bf47","created_utc":"2021-03-23 13:46:39","num_comments":456,"score":4439,"upvote_ratio":0.93,"is_original_content":false,"permalink":"/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mbkb9h/gamestop_can_only_go_up/","title":"Gamestop Can Only Go Up","author":"TheRedRebel4","firstseen":"2021-03-24 21:45:22.247194"}

The stock is trading at multi-year lows, and I believe has an expected return of between 200% and 300% in the next year. The most important catalyst should happen very soon: growth in Q2/19 from their new Wapiti field in Alberta. Given the age of the company (IPO in 1978), legacy field production is much lower than typical shale fields, and requires much less capital to sustain. With a lower declining base and new production from Wapiti, Paramount‚Äôs production should increase after a year of declining. To oversimplify: oil and gas stocks typically move higher when production is higher than expected. With Paramount‚Äôs stock near 20-year lows, and production about to start growing after a year of declining, the stock should have a strong tailwind towards realizing my price target of \\~$20/share. I believe downside is limited (outside of macro oil price shocks), given how low expectations are.¬†\n\nBusiness Description:\n\nParamount has production from three regions, but for simplicity‚Äôs sake, only one of the regions matters to the upside valuation case. The three regions are: Grand Prairie (where the crown jewel assets of Karr and Wapiti reside), Kaybob Region (will likely decline 15-20% per year) and Central Alberta (will likely decline 10-15% per year). The most important region is Grand Prairie, which is currently 1/3rd of production, and consists of the Karr and Wapiti regions. Wells here have payback periods of approximately 15 months, making them amongst the top oil wells in North America. Paramount has drilled over thirty wells at Karr and has seen consistent results. The Wapiti region, which is right next door to Karr, just had their first wells turn online in April/May when Keyera‚Äôs gas processing facility came online. The main growth driver for Paramount will be Karr and Wapiti.¬†\n\nHistory and Why the Stock is Mispriced\n\nToday‚Äôs investment opportunity exists because of what transpired in the last two years. In 2017, Paramount bought Apache‚Äôs assets in Canada. The crown jewel of Apache Canada was the Wapiti region in Alberta; however, production from Wapiti could not start growing until mid-2019 as Paramount had to wait for Keyera to finish building infrastructure in the region. This meant that 2018 should be uneventful year with no growth. Guidance in 2018 was set at flat production of 100kboepd. However, actual production came in at 86kboepd. Paramount‚Äôs stock fell, as most oil and gas stocks do when guidance is reduced.\n\nThe bear thesis on POU is simple: production went from 95kboepd in Q4/17 to 85kboepd in Q4/18 despite $600m of capex and management‚Äôs initial promise of 100kboped of production. Bears don‚Äôt believe management‚Äôs new 2019 guidance for growth to 85-90kboepd in Q4/19 with only $350m of capex. These are the primary reasons why the stock is priced near 20-year lows today.¬†\n\nThe bridge from 95kbodp in Q4/17 to 85kboepd Q4/18 is as follows:\n\n* 5kboepd less from an asset sale (Resthaven land)\n* \\~5kboepd less from disappointing results in their new Duvernay land (exploration region that didn‚Äôt work ‚Äì guidance should have been set more conservatively).\n* \\~5kboepd less from various midstream and third party issues.¬†\n\nExpectations for 2019 production growth are therefore extremely low. I believe Paramount‚Äôs production will exit at nearly 100mboepd (guidance is for 85-90). My simple math is as follows:\n\nKarr:\n\n* Q4/18 production was \\~27kboepd. This has been their best asset recently, and production was kept flat in 2018 (exit to exit) because of midstream constraints. The company expanded their infrastructure slightly in 2H/18 and I believe production could exit 2019 around 30kboepd.¬†\n\nWapiti:\n\n* The company had zero production here in Q4/18, but began turning online wells in May/April when the long awaited Keyera gas processing facility turned online. The company will have over 20 wells drilled and completed this year, and has guided to an average IP 365 of 1395 boepd. If you multiple 20 by 1395 you get nearly 28kboepd of incremental production averaged over the whole year. These wells start off at much higher rates initially, and not all 20 wells will be turned online immediately. I believe Wapiti could therefore exit 2019 producing \\~20kboepd\n\nKaybob region:\n\n* This is a mature old field with a \\~20% decline rate. The company is drilling a few new wells here, and I think production will decline 5% from Q4/18 of 37kboepd to 35kboepd in Q4/19\n\nCentral Alberta:\n\n* This is another mature old and gas field with a \\~15% decline rate. I think production will therefore go from 20kboepd in Q4/18 to 17kboepd in Q4/19.¬†\n\nSummary Q4/19 estimate: Karr at 30, Wapiti at 20, Kaybob at 35 and Central Alberta at 20 = 105kboepd of production versus guidance of 85-90.¬†\n\nI believe 2019 guidance was set conservatively because a new investor relations team, which arrived later in 2018 after initial guidance was set, did not want to repeat the old team‚Äôs mistakes from last year.¬†\n\nWhy will Wapiti results be good?\n\nParamount turned online their first wells at Wapiti in the 2nd quarter, and initial results should be released with Q2 earnings in August. Production could not start until Keyera finished building its gas processing plant in the region, which it did in the 2nd quarter of this year. Various operators with consistently good well results surround Paramount‚Äôs Wapiti region. Below is a map to show proximity:\n\nüì∑\n\nParamount‚Äôs Wapiti type curve shows the wells have payback periods of \\~15 months and IRRs of 45% at $55 oil. Here are neighboring well results that give me confidence in Paramount‚Äôs Wapiti estimates:\n\n* Paramount‚Äôs Karr region: directly south of Wapiti and over 30 wells have been drilled here. Average returns are 64% with 18-month payouts.¬†\n* NuVista‚Äôs Gold Creek acreage: directly west of Wapiti with 40% IRRs. Production in this region started in 2017 and so NuVista has plenty of well history underpinning its type curve.\n* Pipestone Energy‚Äôs acreage: directly north of Wapiti with 60% IRRs.\n\nAll IRRs referenced above assume a $55 WTI oil price.¬†\n\nPotential asset sales: Given the age of the company, Paramount has plenty of assets (both oil and gas acreage and infrastructure) that they could sell. Some analysts believe they could sell their infrastructure at Karr. Karr is currently Paramount‚Äôs best land (64% IRRs referenced above) and inventory life is substantial. Below is my math on Karr‚Äôs potential infrastructure value.\n\nüì∑\n\nValuation\n\nUpside: If Paramount exits 2019 at over 100kboepd, I estimate they could produce between 110 and 120kboepd in 2020. At $55 oil (WTI) and $5 condensate differentials, EBITDA would be \\~$600m. (My EBITDA estimate is after paying their annual abandonment liability). Subtracting debt of $800m, and assuming 5x EBITDA, equity value is over $2.2bn and $17/share. Shares are at $6.8 today.¬†\n\nDownside: If we take 2019 EBITDA consensus of $350m (most sell side is bearish/neutral on the stock) and apply a low 4x multiple, after subtracting $800m of debt the valuation target becomes $4.60/share. Downside is therefore \\~30%. I could imagine such downside scenario if Wapiti results are delayed for some reason (infrastructure constraints or operational problems that have plagued Paramount in the past).¬†\n\nüì∑\n\nRisks:\n\n* Abandonment liability: Paramount has a \\~$800m abandonment liability, which it pays out \\~$30m per year. Recently in Alberta, the government ruled that in bankruptcy the abandonment liability of an oil and gas company becomes senior to bank debt. As such, some investors are concerned that Paramount‚Äôs large abandonment liability could cause its revolver size to be reduced and negatively impact the company‚Äôs liquidity. However, Paramount‚Äôs revolver does not mature until November of 2022. The company has drawn $800m on their $1.5bn revolver, and as such have plenty of liquidity in the interim. I think the company will have material free cash flow after 2020, and so the size of its revolver will become less relevant after 2022.¬†\n* Guidance in 2019 is reduced ‚Äì bears will point out that Paramount reduced guidance in 2018, and the company‚Äôs track record of executing against guidance isn‚Äôt good. If, for whatever reason, Paramount reduces 2019 guidance (because Wapiti wells are below type curve, or infrastructure issues creep up again), I think downside to the stock is 30%. Please see my valuation section above.¬†\n* Oil/gas prices ‚Äì this risk is common to any oil and gas company. One could hedge out these risks by shorting another oil and gas producer.¬†\n\nIn the interest of full disclosure of potential conflicts, I work for a company that currently has a long position in Paramount Resources.¬† The opinions presented here are my own and are based on my research alone, and are not necessarily those of my employer.¬† There is no guarantee that the price targets I‚Äôve modeled will be reached, and the share price could actually decrease depending on trading dynamics, company announcements, market conditions and other unknown factors.\n\nCatalyst\n\nMarket does the math.","created_utc":"2021-03-23 12:38:48","num_comments":28,"score":0,"upvote_ratio":0.4,"is_original_content":false,"permalink":"/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mbisw0/bet_on_hydro_carbons_with_reopening_deep_value/","title":"Bet on Hydro Carbons With Reopening - Deep Value Play","author":"DeepTangerine","firstseen":"2021-03-24 21:45:24.843270"}

This is actually my first DD for you all, I hope you enjoy it. Sirius XM owns their satellite radio company and network, which is **factory installed in about 75% of new American cars**, and they **purchased Pandora in December 2019**, which was the largest internet radio company, whose only real competition is Spotify. I believe the company hasn't fully captured the gains from Pandora's acquisition, and it's in a perfect position to explode with smarter, connected vehicles becoming the norm. Pandora has by far the best learning algorithm to customize stations, and it's primed for some big deals, like the one it just signed with T-Mobile. This stock looks to me to be a fantastic pick, and here's some facts for you all:\n\n1. The **float is 930M-960M shares**, and the short interest has hovered around 160M-200M shares for the past few years (20% of the float). **I know WSB loves to know about short interest, and that's damn high.**\n2. Fundamentals are a dirty word here too, but this stock has pretty great fundamentals. **It's got a 25-35 P/E**, which is both low for a value stock, and low for a growth stock. 45 would be a conservative P/E for a company of this type, while a growth-focused company like Spotify has a -77 P/E ratio and **TSLA has a 1300+ P/E ratio**. Price tripling or quadrupling wouldn't be too difficult to stomach for the market, and that's not even what will happen if this goes to its rightful place in the **stars**.\n\n2a. Still fundamental, **SIRI is actually profitable**, and managed to turn a profit even in the driving hell year of 2020. Almost every market caller has this ranked as being at least a $7-$8 stock, and they don't believe in the squeeze. **If this hits $10, that basically breaks open the option chain, and the market makers and hedges will have to scramble to hedge the stock properly.**\n\n3. The stock is consistently trading in medium-high volumes (though nowhere near the short interest volume), meaning it's ready to move. For a stock with such high volume, **it's clearly only short interest holding the price down**. If market sentiment turns from neutral to bullish, this thing is going to take off.\n\n4. **With low IV in the current option chain, nobody sees this coming. The buy-in on LEAPS is still cheap, and the upside is huge.** This stock looks like a no brainer, easily gonna go up in both the short term and long term, and potential to go way, way over the moon.\n\nIf you need positions, I own 500 shares and 50 LEAPS on this stock. **My short term price target is $9 by summer 2021, and $19 by summer 2022. Buy LEAPS on this, buy some shares, and print your own tickets.**\n\nedit: The catalyst, since it's been asked, is that they merged with Pandora just before the pandemic hit and destroyed the economy. The purchase of another major company never even moved the needle, and there's pent up growth to realize as soon as things reopen, advertising starts to pick up again, and people start buying things. Spotify is their big competition right now, and Spotify is hemorrhaging money, that means there's gonna be a reckoning.","created_utc":"2021-03-23 11:38:19","num_comments":33,"score":35,"upvote_ratio":0.68,"is_original_content":true,"permalink":"/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mbhg31/siri_the_other_satellite_company_that_could_beat/","title":"$SIRI: the other satellite company that could (beat the short sellers)","author":"Ik_SA","firstseen":"2021-03-24 21:45:24.847961"}

They supply to companies like Samsung or LG who controls 95% of the OLED display market. - [source](https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/MAGNACHIP-SEMICONDUCTOR-C-6361073/news/MagnaChip-Semiconductor-Ranked-No-1-in-the-Global-OLED-Smartphone-DDIC-Non-Captive-Market-30995864/)\n\nIf I use my body as an example, my brain tells my body what to do, but without my spinal cord, I'm useless.\n\n* Brain = Processor\n* Body = Display\n* DDIC = Spinal Cord\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/75akoidtqso61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=47aaf7578df9e63380e69dfa7040d1ce0446eede\n\n# History\n\n1. **MX is a 20+ year company that was the first in the market to start developing OLED DDIC (2003). Due to being the first in the market, they have had a lot of time to develop and have accumulated quality IP/Patents and processes for OLED DDIC. -** [source](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/magnachip-surpasses-the-500-million-milestone-in-cumulative-shipments-of-display-driver-ics-for-oled-screens-300891577.html)\n\nWhat is OLED? OLED is the next generation of screens.\n\n* TV went from Tube - LCD - LED\n* Phones are going from LCD - OLED\n\n1. **The issue was, MX was so early to the game (in 2003) that no one was ready for OLED. Smartphones didn't even exist yet. So while MX kept producing other products such as DDIC for LCD, MX kept preparing and developing their baby, knowing that the secret sauce was in the OLED.**\n\n# So what has changed? 5G AND OLED!\n\n1. **As you all know, 5G is going to become the norm within the next 2-3 years.**\n\nIf you have been living under a rock, 5G is the next generation in cellular connectivity, 100x faster which is going to open all sorts of opportunities for the world.\n\nWhen phone manufacturers introduce the new \"latest and greatest\", you can't give a phone with 5G lightning speeds but not upgrade everything else! So manufacturers upgrade other parts of the phone to continuously justify the price point.\n\n2. **Manufacturers need to add things like:**\n\n* Better/slimmer designs\n* Faster processors\n* New Colors\n* But most obviously, better quality screens.\n\nScreens have become more important especially with the rise of the mobile gaming industry. Reports estimate that by the end of 2020, mobile game revenue will hit $76.7 billion, more than the film and music industry combined. - [source](https://www.ironsrc.com/blog/top-51-mobile-app-and-gaming-statistics/). We all know you can't be playing Fortnite or watch Youtube while looking at a potato screen.\n\n# Connecting MX and the rise of 5G\n\nMX has been waiting 18 years for this day to come.\n\n* **MX has recently launched their new DDIC product lines which feature** **a 28nm OLED DDIC (down from 40nm) = smaller thinner phone. The DDIC's also feature -** [source](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/magnachip-launches-28-nanometer-oled-ddic-for-smartphone-displays-300831906.html)\n* 120hz High Frame Rate (HFR) = smoother picture, especially for gaming.\n* compatibility with various display types = rigid, flexible, foldable, VR/AR\n* reduction in power voltage from 1.1v to 1.0 = reducing power consumption by more than 20% and extending battery life\n* reduction in Electromagnetic Interference by 20% = clearer phone calls\n* support for Low-temperature polycrystalline oxide (LTPO) displays = more power efficient backplane = extending battery life\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sdbr7vzuqso61.png?width=316&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ab9c244e170feb1f49ac66a3506693470c7d93b\n\n**In addition, the 28nm OLED DDIC are going to be made in 300mm fabs (factories) = greater profit margin**\n\n* Chips are made in fabs, usually on 200 or 300mm wafers. - [source](http://smithsonianchips.si.edu/ice/cd/CEICM/SECTION7.pdf)\n* 200mm wafers was technology introduced in 1992,\n* This is similar to trying to boil 1 million eggs in a medium sized saucepan.\n* In addition, the saucepan is old and it's possible that the eggs might get cracked = lower yield/lower margins.\n* 300mm wafers are the new standard in making chip making 1 million eggs in a shiny large pot (which has a lower chance of eggs getting cracked) = higher yield/ higher margin\n\n# OLEDs are booming:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ga8351tvqso61.png?width=372&format=png&auto=webp&s=522d1d40be7e52d5b2e4497fecd471292e708f7e\n\n# A few last things... (if you get this innuendo, good job):\n\n1. A Korean tech blog reported that the new iPhone 13 displays will be supplied exclusively by Samsung. It is said that they want\n\n* OLED Screen\n* 120hz HFR\n* LPTO Displays\n\n1. Hmm.. I wonder if Samsung has a relationship with a DDIC company that has the chips that provides/support all that? - [source](http://www.thelec.net/news/articleView.html?idxno=2128)\n2. OLED is here, gaming console usage could become a very large upside opportunity. The Nintendo Switch (upcoming) will have a OLED display (albeit a lower end one, called rigid OLED compared to ones in iPhones)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f7s8adazqso61.png?width=528&format=png&auto=webp&s=fa3b33956770f31b44024ba6c62ee4dbfeea917d\n\nSource: [https://www.tomsguide.com/amp/news/nintendo-switch-pro-oled-analyst-tips-september-release-date-up-to-20-better-battery-life?\\_\\_twitter\\_impression=true](https://www.tomsguide.com/amp/news/nintendo-switch-pro-oled-analyst-tips-september-release-date-up-to-20-better-battery-life?__twitter_impression=true)\n\n4. **MX is also rumored to be for sale as mentioned earlier** [**https://pulsenews.co.kr/view.php?year=2021&no=205435**](https://pulsenews.co.kr/view.php?year=2021&no=205435)\n\n5. AND some frigid weather knocked out Samsung's Austin plant that makes OLED DDICs for Apple  (still shut down as of two weeks ago [source](https://www.statesman.com/story/business/2021/03/10/samsungs-austin-fab-still-shut-down-weeks-after-texas-freeze/6924766002/)). Do you think Apple wants to have all its eggs in one basket going forward?\n\n# Valuation\n\n**Despite a nice run in YTD 2021, MX is still dirt cheap, trading at 8-9x Adj. 2021 EBITDA, which is dirt cheap for a high growth technology stonk.**\n\n**Competitor in the space and recent acquisitions have been at much higher multiples.**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ijqc7681rso61.png?width=496&format=png&auto=webp&s=997b93bff21a09fc00876b3af44462640137a145\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/aqt9abz1rso61.png?width=423&format=png&auto=webp&s=7b5ba3f92b8d03401b10529baf1a57b02e1cb3e2\n\n# What does the current returns projections look like?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1tbnj8v2rso61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=574252d80a8f08002e5936f3d15cc14a081d164b\n\n**I think the company will easily hit $65-70mm EBITDA in 2021 and rerate to a higher EV multiple, in line with competitors who are valued at a 25x-35x EV/EBITDA multiple: 100% upside.

I feel confident that the shorts have this one wrong, but thought the best way to combat my confirmation bias would be to get publicly humiliated by a bunch of other Apes.\n\n**Before I start - yes this is a new account, yes I am new here and was attracted to the site by what has unfolded over the past couple months. That does not change the fact that I now see this as the best and most readily available forum to exchange ideas on a company and get beaten down for shitty DD.**\n\n***Safe harbor***: I am not qualified to give financial advice. Do not trade based solely on my feelings about this companies prospects - do your own damn research and make your own damn decisions.\n\nDescription/Profile from Yahoo Fin below for anyone unaware:\n\n*Academy Sports and Outdoors, Inc., through its subsidiaries, operates as a sporting goods and outdoor recreational products retailer in the United States. The company sells a range of sporting and outdoor recreation products, including sporting equipment, apparel, footwear, camping gear, patio furniture, outdoor cooking equipment, and hunting and fishing gears primarily under the Academy Sports + Outdoors, Magellan Outdoors, BCG, O'rageous, and Outdoor Gourmet brand names. As of August 1, 2020, it operated 259 Academy Sports + Outdoors retail locations in 16 states and three distribution centers located in Katy, Texas, Twiggs County, Georgia, and Cookeville, Tennessee. The company also sells merchandise to customers via academy.com website.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Academy financials:** *I've opted to use Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) as the industry benchmark here - not perfect, but similar enough to help understand the relative financial health of ASO compared to the market leader*\n   * Market Cap: 2.25B (*DKS 7B*)\n   * Trailing P/E: 9.31 (*DKS 13.83*)\n   * Operating Cash Flow (ttm): 1.03B (*DKS 1.55B)*\n   * Current Ratio (liquidity): 1.61 *(DKS 1.47) - for folks who don't look at the balance sheet too often, current ratio is the comparison of current assets to current liabilities. Higher number typically indicates that you have a healthy balance of assets/liabilities - though too high could mean you aren't taking enough risk or appropriately levered.*\n   * **Q3 2020 Earnings:** Q3 2020 sales were up 18% vs prior year. **Think about Q3 2020 -** most of the country still in lockdown, tensions rising and people flocked to these stores as a materialism escape OR to ready their defenses. Gross margin of 33% which was up 110 bps over previous year in the middle of the pandemic - great control of costs.\n* **Dick's Measuring**: One area I think a lot of people are missing when comparing to Dick's ($DKS) is that, while ASO is more niche and not yet as widely recognized, the sales per store is significantly higher due to the fanaticism and mix of goods sold here. As ASO continues expanding (currently only in 16 states!), Revenue will catch up to DKS quickly and the increase in scale will improve margins:\n   * ASO: 260 stores with 5.5 B in Revenue (ttm) = **21M per store**\n   * DKS: 850 stores with 8.7 B in Rev = **10.2M per store**\n   * This tells me that either **Academy is doing a better job in how they select the physical locations for their stores, or they have a stronger mix of online to brick and mortar sales than DKS**\n* **Public Listing Fuel**: To me, ASO has significant upside - that being said, the stock price has essentially doubled since its listing as shorts continue to double down. ASO has an excellent opportunity to utilize this price growth as fuel for expansion. Currently, only about 1/3 of their total shares outstanding are considered floating shares, most likely due to the post-IPO lock-down  (more to come on this in the \"what scares me section\" below).\n   * At this point about 8% of shares are held by insiders vs 4% for DKS. This is a good sign to me and a vote of confidence in upward movement, but will be keeping an eye on this figure after the lock-out period expires.\n* **Guns and Butter**: Sure, we can make the argument that gun/ammo sales are through the roof - an area that ASO plays in that DKS does not. For me, this offers more of a short term benefit than anything - a potential catalyst for stronger than expected earnings however not sure we can hang our hopes and dreams on everyone in America buying a small arsenal.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Here is what scares me:\n   * ASO has only recently become public. A few stray assumptions can cause turmoil down the road as the steady state of the business becomes clear.\n   * On top of this, the \"lock out\" period for company insiders expires at the end of this month - they have also placed their Q4 earnings the day before this lock-out expires. Read into that as you will.\n   * Of course, on top of all of this, the company itself needs to be managed well from the top. They have made a few recent notable personnel moves (Tom Nealson from Southwest Airlines appointed to board), however I know little about the track record or competence of the leadership at Academy.\n\nPOSITIONS - *keep in mind i am fairly new to investing and don't have quite the liquidity i would like to trade bigly:*\n\nHad 5 3/16 30c - sold 2 and 3 rode into the ground\n\n3 - 4/16 30c\n\n1 - 10/15 35c\n\n20 shares at $24.50\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit - couple typo's that i cleaned up.","created_utc":"2021-03-23 11:18:59","num_comments":27,"score":76,"upvote_ratio":0.76,"is_original_content":false,"permalink":"/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mbh0vn/aso_dd_why_the_shorts_are_probably_wrong/","title":"$ASO DD - why the shorts are probably wrong","author":"Over_Breadfruit2988","firstseen":"2021-03-24 21:45:24.849534"}

However, since people in my life know my main account, I have decided to delete it in accordance to Part 1; Chapter 1:* ***Don't tell anyone****. That being said, I still wanted to help out as many of my friends here that I can, so I'm uploading this again on my alternative account. In the process, I have taken all of the feedback that I received in the first post, and have created the ultimate compilation of DD resources for your new financial life as a Millionaire. I hope this helps out my brothers and sisters here!*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, you did it. You did your due diligence, you did the math, you summoned your courage to press that 'Buy' button, and now those stocks and options have granted you a title you only dreamed of having.\n\n\"Millionaire\".\n\nCongratulations! You beat the odds that so many before you have failed to overcome. You played the game, and came out on top. Your thoughts are racing as you realize all that you can do with this newfound wealth. Now it's time to buy that house you always dreamed of, or that car you always wanted to drive, right? And now I can go on that luxury vacation to that resort I always wanted to go to! But, slowly, there may be this other feeling that washes over you.\n\nFear.\n\nSlowly, you feel a wrinkle form on your brain, as you begin to realize how big of a responsibility this truly is, and how unique of an opportunity this is. You know that you may only have this shot once, and don't want to screw it up. Well, if this community has shown us anything over these past 4 months or so, it's that knowledge is power! So fear not, my friends! For in the paragraphs ahead lie your survival guide for the next 6 months!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*\"What do you mean, a 'survival guide'?\"*\n\nThis guide will be broken into 3 parts. The first section contains life advice as for how to socially, and mentally handle these unprecedented funds. The second part **does not contain financial advice**, but rather the resources to do your own research, and figure out a financial plan that would benefit you the most. The reason being is that it would be irresponsible for me to tell you what to do with your money. Beyond that, every person here has a different story. Some folks may have a partner and 3 kids, while others my still be living at home. Instead, I would like to give you all the tools to build a successful life using these new funds. The third section goes over where to go from here now that you've built a solid foundation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*\"Ok, I understand what's in this guide, but why now? Why not after a squeeze?\"*\n\nGreat question! I considered posting it after a squeeze on a particular stock, but I realized that some everyday folks have already won big on well placed call options. If I can give at least one person pause to reflect, and help someone avoid making a huge mistake with their windfall...that would be enough. I'm by no means an expert, I'm just trying to look out for the people here.\n\nSo, without further ado, let us begin.\n\n\\-----\n\n# Part 1 - Social and Emotional Survival\n\nChapter 1\n\nProtecting it from everyone else\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**DON'T TELL ANYBODY.** If there is one thing you take away from this, let it be this. So let me repeat that...\n\n**DON'T.**\n\n**TELL.**\n\n**ANYONE.**\n\nThis is going to be your most well kept secret in your life. At least in the beginning. You will probably feel the urge to tell your friends, and your family, but doing this *WILL* ruin your life. Why? Well, first, people are going to find it harder to relate to you. Snide remarks such as, ‚Äúlook at Moneybags over here‚Äù, ‚Äúmust be nice‚Äù, or ‚Äúremember the little guy‚Äù, may weed their ways into the conversations people have with you. You‚Äôll see your relationships slowly change as people no longer relate to some of the things going on in your life. (Not everyone in your life is going to be worried about finding a tax advisor that specializes in the wealthy!)\n\nOn top of that, they‚Äôre gonna smell money, and many of them may want a cut.\n\nThey're gonna say they need that new device, or they need that new car, or they want to start this unusual business venture, or they need this or that. They'll bring up how far you go back. Suddenly, you'll see the very people who have been your friends, turn on you like vultures. They may think they have your best interests in mind, and they may not know the emotional and relationship damage they're causing, but they'll smell money, and they're gonna come asking.\n\nBy that point, you‚Äôve lost. You‚Äôre stuck between a rock and a hard place. You may have to be the bad guy and say, ‚Äúno‚Äù. And some of those relationships may quickly fall apart as you deny them. Or the alternative is that you're gonna bleed your money 'helping' everyone while they take advantage of you and indulge their overspending habits.\n\nThere's also the concern of your safety. People who are lottery winners are found to be much more likely to be a victim of kidnapping, blackmail and murder. That's not to say you can't live an upper middle class lifestyle, but be careful with how flashy and open you are with your earnings.\n\nTo put it differently, this isn't a question of who do you tell, because word spreads. Rather, this is a question of social survival. Do you want to maintain your relationship with your friends and family? Yes? Then keep it to yourself. Eventually, you may find people that you trust, and can let them in on the secret. But you can‚Äôt take back your words once you say them. Be very careful with who knows.\n\n*Money talks, but wealth whispers.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nChapter 2\n\nProtecting it from expenses\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you want this money to last more than 5 years, you're gonna want to treat it as if it wasn't there.\n\n*\"Wait, what? Then why do I have this money if I'm not gonna use it?!\"* You will use it. Just not as a sum of cash. If you have $1.8 million after taxes, you are not going to go out and buy a $1 million dollar house and a $200,000 Lamborghini. You'll only have $600,000 left! And while this may sound like a lot, it won't go nearly as far as you might think. Instead, you might want to turn to **FIRE**, or **Financial Independence, Retire Early.** There, you are going to use your newfound money as a *source of income.* I'll go over the details in Part 2; Chapter2, but for now, an easy equation for this is 4%. That's it. That's the equation. 4% of your net worth can be used yearly, while your money still sits in investments and accrues roughly 7% interest annually. This way you beat inflation, and you cover your expenses.\n\nSo, to use our $1.8 million under the 4% rule, that's *$72,000* you can spend annually, and in theory you will never run out of funds, while never working another day in your life if you don't want to. Or, if you enjoy what you're doing, you can add that to the equation as well. How you break it up is up to you, but you can very easily spend north of $100,000 a year, and still be in the green if you hold down a job.\n\nMeanwhile, let's check in on our $600,000. That's *$24,000* a year you can spend for the rest of your life if you wanted to retire today. That's uncomfortably close to the poverty line. You're a millionaire. You don't deserve that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nChapter 3\n\nProtecting it from yourself\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYes. Yourself. As quickly as you made your money, you can easily lose it in the best 2 weeks of your life. So right now, emotions are probably high. You're beyond excited, you are itching to do something crazy with your money, and probably want to buy something, since you can't tell anyone per Chapter 1. But I implore, please **don't buy anything right now.**\n\nYes, you read that right. Don't buy anything. If you need any proof on that, look up what happens to lottery winners. Roughly 35% of them go *bankrupt within 10 years of winning!* Rather, set the money aside for a while. You can determine this amount of time, but a good rule of thumb is 6 months. In those 6 months, it gives you plenty of time to calm yourself, collect your thoughts, and figure out an actual plan on how to wisely use that money. How you want to invest it, how much you want to use per year, and how much you owe in *taxes*. Yes. The dreaded, 't-word'. *Taxes*. You've gotta pay up. And during that planning process, you'll have to come to terms with what this money is going to do for your life.\n\n\\-----\n\n# Part 2 - Economic Survival\n\nChapter 1\n\nTaxes\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRoughly 40% of earnings over $500K is going to go to the federal government. That's not even accounting for any state income taxes (which vary wildly from state to state). And before we continue, I will allow a moment for a collective \"*ouch*\" from everyone reading.\n\nThat's a lot. I won't deny that. But as much as it sucks, you've gotta pay up. Because if you don't, the IRS can very, very easily take ALL of it. 100%. And they will, leaving you behind with nothing but lawyer and court fees, and no money to pay them. So please, please, please, make sure you pay the taxes my friends!\n\nWith that said, since you are a millionaire, you have the resources to retain the services of a CPA who specializes in the wealthy and ultra-wealthy. And I would highly advise doing your research and getting the best one you can find, as otherwise you may be overpaying by the thousands! Also, in compliance with Chapter 1; Part 1, please do not go to a family friend, or even someone in your area. If you can travel (or in the case of COVID, WebEx/Zoom) to a CPA out of your area, even better! Find someone based on quality, not convenience!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nChapter 2\n\nDebt\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you have any debt in your life, now would be the time to review that. Any high interest debt such as credit cards, car loans, personal loans, student loans, etc. I would advise paying off immediately. Otherwise, those interest rates will bleed you dry, and take away from your profits, and your attempt to be financially independent.\n\nNow, if you have a mortgage, this would be at your discretion. Some people advise paying off the house with the rest of the debt if you have the available capital to do so. This way it removes the last payment from your life. However, the alternative school of thought is that your money is going to earn more money in an investment than it will save in the interest when you pay the house off immediately. This again will be at your discretion. If you're planning on proceeding with FIRE (more details in Chapter 3), my personal recommendation would be to pay off the mortgage up front, so that you aren't putting a strain on your new income source.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nChapter 3\n\nFIRE\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFIRE, or Financial Independence Retire Early is a movement that has been gaining traction as of late, with the goal of making retirees out of 20-40 year olds. As mentioned above, the equation is simple. You take your net worth, and figure out what is 4% of it. So if you have $2 million dollars, 4% of that is $80,000. That means that you can live off $80,000 a year for the rest of your life without changing a thing, and be financially independent.\n\nNow, how exactly does this work? Well in the 90's, a man named Bill Bengen figured out that the worst case scenario for a rate of return from typical stock market investments year-over-year was 7%. So that means in theory, you can retire on your earnings and never touch the principle. Now, you can adjust this number as you see fit depending on your returns or any other streams of income, however for people trying to retire in their 20's, I would advise staying conservative with the 4% since this money needs to last you a lifetime. The other 3% is there to build the principle and protect it from inflation, which increases by 2%-3% annually.\n\nThis would be the standard FIRE. However, there are 4 other types of FIRE:\n\n* **Lean FIRE** \\- Living on less than you make, roughly $40,000 a year\n* **Fat FIRE** \\- Living a retirement of luxury, roughly between $100,000-$120,000 (double the standard household income in your area)\n* **Barista FIRE** \\- Using the same principles as above, but you are picking up a part time job or a gig job that you enjoy. This will supplement some of the money that you take out of your investments.\n* **Coast FIRE** \\- This last version is similar to Barista FIRE, however you use the power of compound interest to become financially independent later. You continue to work now, while your investments grow in the background. You don't need to add another cent to retirement as they will grow in the markets, however you are not financially independent today.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nChapter 3\n\nInvestments\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBefore I proceed, this is once again, NOT financial advice. Now, with that disclaimer out of the way...\n\nI believe the smartest thing you can do would be to invest in appreciating assets, rather than buy depreciating assets such as cars. These come in many forms (which I will cover below), but what ties them together is that they are all a source of income. Your money on it's own isn't generating additional money. But you are also in a unique position of not having to work for your money. *It's time to make your money work for you.*\n\n**Stock Market** \\- One of the most common sources of passive income is the stock market. For the sake of your financial future, I would not put most of your portfolio into single stocks. While I'm not saying avoid single stocks all together, I wouldn't invest more than 10% of your net worth into them. Any more than that carries the risk of severely crippling your retirement portfolio. Boring ETF's, bonds and mutual funds may be a safer play. I am obligated to advise you to do your research before making any decisions on what to invest in.\n\n**Real Estate** \\- Another popular investment is Real Estate. This comes in may forms, from flipping houses, to becoming a real estate agent, or buying rental properties. The benefits to the real estate market is that you are left with something. A hedge fund isn't able to come along and short your house into the ground. Your house is yours. If the stock market crashes, or a company goes under, you're at a loss. It's easier to ride out the waves with real estate. With it though, comes more work. You are now a landlord, and have to mange the properties, and find new tenants as the old ones move out. It's not as passive of an income as the Stock Market.\n\n**Businesses** \\- \"Small business is the backbone of our economy.\" While it seems to be every politicians catchphrase, they're not wrong. Small businesses are extremely important to the success of our nation, and you now have the capital to make your own. If you have something that you're really passionate about, I would fully endorse you going out and either buying a business, or building your own business for your passion from the ground up! However, this is much, much more work than the passive investments of the stock market.\n\n\\-----\n\n# Part 3 - What Comes Next?\n\nChapter 1\n\nSpending\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlright, so you've made it this far. Now, we're going to take all that we've learned, and form an action plan. First, the spending. Make sure you build a budget for your spending and track what leaves your accounts. Just because you're wealthy doesn't mean we can get sloppy! Remember, we're trying to keep you a millionaire! When it comes to spending, don't overextend yourself. If you want a life of financial independence, you will need to discipline yourself and stay within your means. This money has to last a lifetime after all! I would also advise that any further day trading that you do comes out of the annual funds available for spending (as calculated by the 4% rule). This way, if you make a risky options play, or a stock flounders, it won't hurt you long term! And remember, hold less than 10% of your net worth in single stocks!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nChapter 2\n\nBuilding a cabinet\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, if what I've said so far isn't resonating with you, and you would rather be walked through these major financial decisions, then I would advise assembling a committee that can help you through this. Whether you choose to rely on them for the short term as you get your feet wet, or the long term to ensure someone keeps you in check, will again be at your discretion. But before I proceed with my recommended positions for your financial committee, I will remind you that time is money. If you put the time in to learn the principles of personal finances, then it will save you a lot of money in the long term. That said, some people just want to set the money aside and forget about it, and that's ok too! For a fully staffed committee, I would recommend a financial advisor, a tax advisor/CPA, a real estate advisor (should you want to enter real estate), an attorney, and an insurance advisor.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nChapter 3\n\nGiving\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd now that you have a solid financial foundation to stand on, one that will be passed onto your kids, and possibly even your grandkids, we can begin to make the world a better place. You can now begin to give. Now, giving is a broad term in this sense. It can range anywhere from giving the valet a generous tip to park your shiny car, to donating $2500 to your local food bank just before Thanksgiving. But just like with spending, you want to make sure you don't overextend yourself. If you are a responsible steward with your money, you can ensure that you can help many more people for years to come. To do so, I would advise taking the money not out of your principle, but rather on your annually allotted funds.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nChapter 4\n\nSources for you to perform your own Due Diligence\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn this chapter, I have included some good sources to begin your own due diligence. While I don't necessarily agree with everything that they all say, it's up to you to find what works best for you!\n\n[How to survive winning the lottery - Reddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/24vo34/whats_the_happiest_5word_sentence_you_could_hear/chb4v05/) \\- An extremely detailed Reddit post describing how to survive winning the lottery.\n\n*Graham Stephan - YouTube* *:* Graham Stephan is a self-made millionaire who achieved financial independence in his 20's. (Automod does not allow YouTube links, so you will need to search for this channel independently)\n\n*Dave Ramsey Show - YouTube* *:* A religious millionaire who hosts a radio show revolving around teaching people how to get out of debt and take control of their personal finances to become (and stay) millionaires. (Automod does not allow YouTube links, so you will need to search for this channel independently)\n\n[https://investedwallet.com/types-of-fire-in-finance/](https://investedwallet.com/types-of-fire-in-finance/) \\- A resource for a more detailed description of FIRE.\n\n[Windfall - r/personalfinance Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/windfall) \\- Lots of good resources on advice for people who receive windfalls.\n\n\\-----\n\nSo there you have it. A starter guide on how to survive your first few months as a new millionaire, written by someone who has never been a millionaire! But I have seen some people make some awful mistakes regarding money, and did my due diligence on what happens after someone gains a massive windfall. And I have a feeling that more than a handful of you might be seeing a windfall come your way in the near future...\n\nTo close, they say money can't buy you happiness, but I'm often reminded of the scene from Captain America, where Steve is told, ***\"The serum amplifies everything that is inside. So, good becomes great. Bad becomes worse.\"***\n\nMoney is only going to amplify how you want to live your life. If you're happy now, you'll be even happier. If you're snobby now, you'll become even snobbier. If you want to live generously, leaving anonymous gifts and donations, giving all you have away, you can do that. If you want to live egregiously expensive and live it up, over spending at every turn, you can also do that. But you will need to face the consequences of all those decisions.\n\nAnd if you, in your nature, default to one of these paths, but don't want to, it will take all the more effort to avoid it than if you didn't have this money at all.\n\nOh who am I kidding. You're the apes on Wall Street! You will all be fine. Just be careful, my friends. As this is a fight that may last the rest of your life.","created_utc":"2021-03-23 10:35:18","num_comments":564,"score":5104,"upvote_ratio":0.97,"is_original_content":false,"permalink":"/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mbg2t5/how_to_keep_your_newly_minted_title_of/","title":"How to Keep Your Newly Minted Title of Millionaire (2nd Edition)","author":"Exact-Introduction-5","firstseen":"2021-03-24 21:45:24.851953"}

For anyone who wants to know more about Aphria's history, I suggest you guys read those posts first because I won't repeat earlier points I've made.\n\n# Introduction\n\nOkay retards, I lied. I said my previous post would be my last before merger, but with recent developments I could not help but make another post. My last post was also pretty badly timed for anyone looking to hold until merger, price was around $23.7 then. The price did go up to about $32 in the next few days so you could have also made a huge profit if you sold on the way up. But I advised you guys to hold until merger so I might have involuntarily created some bagholders with my last post, for which I'm sorry. To those who are holding through losses, don't despair. Aphria has a bright future ahead with the Tilray merger now in its final stage. That's what I'll be talking about in this post, so anyone interested please read.\n\n# Merger finalizing: arbitrage opportunity largely vanished\n\nFor anyone who doesn't know, on April 14th Aphria will host a shareholder meeting where they'll vote on the merger and on April 16th Tilray will do the same for their shareholders. This was announced about a week ago. Both companies cooperated in making a website for their shareholders on [www.aphriatilraytogether.com](https://www.aphriatilraytogether.com) with all the information you could possibly need. I especially recommend the Investors and FAQ sections. I know you guys are lazy fucks so I will summarize the most important info in bullet points:\n\n* **On April 14th Aphria will host a shareholder meeting at 4 pm EST on** [**www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/APHA2021**](https://www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/APHA2021)**. However, only registered shareholders can ask questions and vote on the merger. We can attend as guests if we fill out an online form.** Only shareholders with a significant position are registered. Most of us retail traders hold shares through an intermediary (brokers) so we can't vote unless the intermediary gives us notice. \n* **Both boards are unanimously in favor of the merger and are encouraging shareholders to vote FOR the merger.** Major shareholders will follow the board's advice. So sit back and relax, this merger thing will go through.\n* **Each holder of Aphria shares will receive 0.8381 of a Tilray Share for each Aphria Share. There will be no fractional Tilray shares.** I'll clarify this with a numerical example. I have 30 shares of Aphria, so I should receive 0.8381\\*30 = 25.14 Tilray shares. But there are no fractional shares, so I round down to the nearest whole number: I will receive 25 Tilray shares on merger date. The transaction should go through without any additional costs or taxes.\n* **Often mergers go through about a month after shareholders voted on it. Following this logic,**   \n**a potential merger date should be sometime in the middle of May.** I should say that this is not all at confirmed by either Aphria and Tilray, but it is just based on common practice. The exact merger date will probably be announced a week beforehand.\n\nIn my previous posts I always underlined that there was a small chance that the merger doesn't go through or that the merger split would be changed. Those two chances have both become 0% since the announcement of the meetings and creation of that website. This is why the arbitrage opportunity that I also highlighted in my last two posts has largely disappeared. \n\nCurrently Aphria is noted at $18.53 and Tilray at $23.56, which makes the split 0.7865 so the difference to the merger split has almost disappeared at a 0.0516 margin. This is probably due to big players on the stock market noticing and closing the gap. You can still buy in right now with a small benefit, but it's no longer a big lucrative play. Anyone still looking to buy in should just do it for the merger and the positive future of the cannabis market globally.\n\n**TLDR:** Last week Aphria and Tilray confirmed their merger with upcoming shareholder meetings and an informative website ([AphriaTilrayTogether](https://www.aphriatilraytogether.com)). Voting on the merger is finalized after the meetings on April 14th and 16th. Shareholders will surely vote in favor of the merger, so the potential merger date should be somewhere in the middle of May (not confirmed). Arbitrage opportunity is now almost fully gone.\n\n**Position:** Nothing changed, my 30 shares @ $8.74 are still standing strong.","created_utc":"2021-03-23 09:32:24","num_comments":67,"score":123,"upvote_ratio":0.78,"is_original_content":false,"permalink":"/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mbest8/aphria_inc_apha_merger_secured_details_here/","title":"Aphria Inc (APHA): merger secured, details here üòÆ‚Äçüí®ü•¶üöÄüöÄüöÄ","author":"Mattras7","firstseen":"2021-03-24 21:45:24.855249"}

However, with the latest round of orchestrated \"flash crashes\" being done on meme stocks, and Fintel actually reporting lower \"Short Volume Ratio\" afterwards, I set out to find out just what the hell is going on.\n\nTurns out, Fintel gets their Short Volume figure from FINRA's [Daily Short Sale Volume Files](http://regsho.finra.org/regsho-Index.html). Through that webpage, you can find short volume data for any stock for any given day. For example, today 2021-03-22, FINRA maintains that GME had a **short volume of 2,358,752** with a **total volume of 3,843,634**. And according to FINRA, Total Volume is defined as \"**share volume of all executed trades during regular trading hours**.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[FINRA Daily Short Sale Volume File Format Legend](https://preview.redd.it/l45d11be6po61.png?width=774&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a4298fe454531bedf29690f7db0bb901785a0c3)\n\nAlright, that's cool and all but what is wrong? Well, the problem is the Total Volume figure reported by FINRA is completely off and the fact that services like Fintel uses FINRA's short volume data to calculate short volume ratio presents inaccurate data to the public.\n\nFor example, Fintel is currently reporting a **23%** Short Volume Ratio for GME as of 2021-03-22. The way they calculate Short Volume Ratio is simply take the Short Volume figure from FINRA (**2,358,752**) divided by the Total Volume. Whao, but Fintel is showing **10,054,700** as the Total Volume for GME, what?\n\n[Fintel uses the Short Volume figure from FINRA. Example: 2021-03-22, Short Volume for GME: 2,358,752. However, Fintel disagrees with FINRA in that Fintel uses 10,054,700 as the total volume whereas FINRA maintains GME only had 3,843,634 total volume.](https://preview.redd.it/5g4lhepc7po61.png?width=821&format=png&auto=webp&s=8f5c94c82d5a01181d73667ebeeb7feed416e25e)\n\nOkay, let see then..\n\n[ Yahoo Finance shows GME had a volume of 9,573,686 on 2021-03-22.](https://preview.redd.it/m3483d888po61.png?width=514&format=png&auto=webp&s=401ab28bc0b80a29c43d0ec4d358566bb035dae3)\n\n[ WeBull shows GME had a volume of 10,060,000 on 2021-03-22.](https://preview.redd.it/8v5abi8g8po61.png?width=980&format=png&auto=webp&s=8f2cab05661faa8c6c1d132baa7eae18f7ebf79b)\n\n[ Robinhood shows GME had a volume of 10,060,000 on 2021-03-22.](https://preview.redd.it/fp0t9tkn8po61.png?width=796&format=png&auto=webp&s=3c3eacd125e70226892e147187be9189558a4084)\n\n[ Fidelity shows GME had a volume of 10,061,505 on 2021-03-22.](https://preview.redd.it/nrkys7cv8po61.png?width=1012&format=png&auto=webp&s=aee32b3251553ab514d1835f9fa0b540e5d9bb27)\n\nYou get the picture. Four sources confirmed that GME had a total volume of \\~10M on 2021-03-22. Why the hell is FINRA reporting only 3.8M as the total volume? YES, I am aware that FINRA breaks down their report by markets. I specifically did the analysis based on their \"consolidated\" data across markets B *(NASDAQ TRF Chicago)*, Q *(NASDAQ TRF Carteret)* and N *(NYSE TRF)* So, what the hell?\n\nOnce I start questioning that, I had to check FINRA's short volume report for a longer time span for GME. Turns out, FINRA has been under-reporting total volume for all tickers since.. ever. Here I compare what FINRA is reporting vs what Yahoo and Fidelity are reporting. (Blue: FINRA, Red: Yahoo and Yellow: Fidelity)\n\n[ GME Total Trading Volume as reported by FINRA, Yahoo & Fidelity \\(2021-01-01 to 2021-03-22\\) \\[Check sources below raw data\\]](https://preview.redd.it/wj18e4vpcpo61.png?width=1554&format=png&auto=webp&s=ecf1121443100b84f7e78e92b7c9c9ceafe96f44)\n\nAs you can see, Yahoo and Fidelity pretty much align 100% on what the total volume is, but FINRA ***\\_never\\_*** reported even remotely close to what others are reporting. Again, keep in mind the FINRA data I used in this analysis is consolidated across markets.\n\nThe ramification of using FINRA's short volume and the total volume of what everyone else is reporting is underestimating the short volume ratio. If we go by the total volume reported by FINRA, we actually get 2358752 / 3843634= **61.4%** Short Volume Ratio. However, sites like Fintel uses that 2358752 short volume figure and the total volume \\~10M figure, that gives a low **23%** Short Volume Ratio. The difference is dramatic.\n\n**The questions that need to be answered are: what is FINRA reporting? Why do the total volume they report so different than everybody else's? How confident and reliable are their Short Volume data then? If their consolidated data turns out to be not consolidated, are they deceiving the public in that services like Fintel report a fraction of the real Short Volume Ratio as a result?**\n\nFor the record, I did check other stocks *(blue chips, meme stocks, EV.. etc.)* FINRA ***\\_always\\_*** under-report the total volume.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**EDIT TO ADD:**\n\n[Fintel's definition on short volume.](https://preview.redd.it/8mhntjpp4to61.png?width=711&format=png&auto=webp&s=68b7285ff634d1f16e313ec990ddc9989509c01f)\n\nFintel takes the Short Volume figure from FINRA at face value and divided it by a number (total volume) that includes more markets than FINRA does. *(FINRA's total volume reported does not include or align with exchange volume and they only count trades that are \"publicly disseminated\")*\n\nIn the end, we learn that the data from FINRA is not complete *(perhaps there will never be a single source of truth when it comes to market data.)* and should not be taken at face value.

Think about customer service. Think about who the customer is.\n\nWalk into gamestop. Walk into Pet Smart. Walk into Best Buy. Walk into Target. Ask yourself what could be better and why things are the way they are. Could we do better?\n\nWhen you‚Äôve mastered customer service, willingness to pay increases.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9muytpqzpoo61.png?width=1401&format=png&auto=webp&s=ef5ee3353d240709a49a6a3faafeb7986a5ac1b8\n\n# Purpose\n\nDisclaimer: Don‚Äôt use this DD to confirm your bias as a means to make silly choices. Use it as an opportunity to learn you dingus!\n\nSome of you folk may remember the DD I wrote about Cloudflare and serverless computing back in May 2020, but most of those posts were written far less seriously and lacked professionalism. To be frank, I was surprised by the hunger for knowledge and I really enjoyed debating some of the rather brazen people here.\n\nWSB has grown and in my view, our committed analysts tend to BTFO Wall Street analysts. We have on-the-ground experience as laborers, customers, and digital-natives that they often filter out of a privileged ignorance.\n\nPart of this is also due to the fact that I believe that investing in securities will become increasingly complex yet accessible for a typical retail investor which will either result in isolation OR incentivize cooperation.\n\n* Does the average retail investor really understand the core regulatory influences in investments like Square, PayPal, or even rob-the-hood? **(Square DD Complete)**\n* How do we compare social media? **(Pinterest DD Complete)**\n* What really is customer service? **(You are here)**\n* Are we familiar with new international trades that increase Mexican-Texan manufacturing? **(Kansas City Southern DD in Revision Mode)**\n* Is the average retail investor familiar with the network models that govern software like Fastly and Twilio? (**Google DD in Progress)**\n* Do we understand incentives vs. bias? **(Roblox DD in Progress)**\n* How knowledgable are we of fashion trends that make Nike and Foot Locker valuable? **(You are here)**\n* Is an average retail investor familiar with competitive types of manufacturing processes when they invest in technologies like AMD or GE?\n\nAt the end of the day, I am an educator and I believe that the goal of education is to engage a reader into a deeper curiosity or discussion, so that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm sharing my writing. I‚Äôm not here to convince you that this stock is even a good choice - but to explore the economics behind it.\n\n# First Phase: Real Estate\n\nWalk into Best Buy. They do some things right, and they do some things wrong. Want into the gaming section of Target. Notice the activity levels in the region, but think critically of the real-estate afforded to it. How does it affect your experience?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hsbr69iatoo61.jpg?width=750&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=da613414e26bae76282c1cde1b93bd6c4a4c27f8\n\nUltimately, a floor design is a subset of customer service and sale intentions. A location that sells furniture and diet pills may not service customers the same way a place that sells gaming culture (stream, cosplay) and gaming devices products. GameStop will predictably close down smaller shops, while expanding the size of others to produce an alternative service. Gamestop will no longer be a convenience store aisle, but rather an area for culture.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8wzo5ehztoo61.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e321d639c41825f50b999e3fe8c9f68e55222caf\n\nThe reason for this is clear. Gaming is **BIG** where many players will win. Gaming expands multiple culture vectors. Movies, cosplay events, entertainment parks, meta-verses, sold out arenas, cafes, midnight releases and home development. If you have an industry where people WILL wait in line, you have a goldmine of an industry.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rfg1hnt9voo61.jpg?width=573&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dc610af0af2faa9d17217a1836ac0ffd2991f271\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wl15qmicvoo61.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=57fb1c160657525a45861611f5a8b335aa6544a0\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Second Phase: Customer Service\n\nYou as a dear millennial, or parent of a millennial, understand that gaming is larger than life, and that experience will never fundamentally change. Ryan Cohen understands this. It is the core of an American market, much like Chewey‚Äôs targeting of pets. What Ryan cohen seeks is to breech the American household rather than to compete with the likes of Amazon or Target. Ultimately, Cohen is a proud student of Jeff Bezos. This is a stated fact by himself.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mkbo52yswoo61.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fd04ea2474c5e72666b9ca5f01cd2d96d590bbc6\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5a1qcru48po61.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a8fec7d952782ffd663b399dd72361576d86fb9b\n\nAsk yourself:\n\n\\- What if a parent wants to buy a high-grade computer setup for their child? Is it reasonable to assume that a 54-year old mother will understand the differences between AMD and NVIDIA graphics cards?\n\n\\- What services can Gamestop capture to produce economic value for streamers, cosplay, and e-sports consumers?\n\n\\- What products exist beyond Corsair, Logitech, and other big-name products? Do small manufacturers produce good value products that customers may love?\n\n‚Äì Can things like Legos, Roblox, Minecraft, and Nintendo find themselves in the same space?\n\n\\- Is it possible to have GameStop create integrations with services like Unity, Steam, Roblox, and other digital services? How rapidly could GameStop capitalize on successes like Among Us or other sectors like child-gaming?\n\n\\- Can GameStop capture bigger sports and sports-betting markets?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/33q7ksn7voo61.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d4042e97ce8df20e5be17824c532d1e3dfb2eace\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Summary\n\nDespite GameStop being in a meme state, it was quite obvious that the organization was undervalued relative to the larger American or global gaming market. The company stagnated and had a weak formula for success in a rapidly evolving retail sector. I personally believe that Gamestop has the potential to sustain beyond 20-30B market cap if it operates and succeeds strategically. The first step was to have leadership that understands the larger-than-life nature of technology and culture, which it has achieved. The next step is transforming the companies space to properly service its customers and products. The final step is to overhaul the customer service to increase engagement, satisfaction, and to put the ‚Äúcustom‚Äù in customer.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zhm3ea7h2po61.jpg?width=850&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9ccf471f1e8269b636349fce6ac57bd81ee77872\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Naruto: Believe It!](https://preview.redd.it/0himvwbl8po61.jpg?width=760&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7b8b60a889c0debf8c37c69b5cddc1517c0c53df)\n\n[https://media.nichegamer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/09182715/Reggie-GameStop-03-09-2020.jpg](https://media.nichegamer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/09182715/Reggie-GameStop-03-09-2020.jpg)","created_utc":"2021-03-22 23:12:43","num_comments":223,"score":2047,"upvote_ratio":0.95,"is_original_content":false,"permalink":"/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mb585a/sigh_understanding_gamestop_ryan_cohen_customer/","title":"*SIGH* Understanding GameStop: Ryan Cohen, Customer Service, and The Great Long.

The 1st part introduced Impulse waves rules and guidelines. The 2nd part covered Diagonals and the first corrective waves - zigzags. I also included some examples of actual charts, rather than the simple drawings in the first post. If you have not read part 1 or 2 yet, please do before reading this. I would advise everyone to save each part and read them over again as they learn.\n\nAnyway, here goes.\n\n**Corrective waves**\n\n*Contracting Triangles:*\n\nRules:\n\n* A triangle always subdivides into five waves\n* At least four waves among waves A, B, C, D and E each subdivide into a zigzag or zigzag combination\n* Wave C never moves beyond the end of wave A, wave D never moves beyond the end of wave B, and wave E never moves beyond the end of C. The result is that, going forward in time, a line connecting the ends of waves B and D converges with a line connecting the ends of waves A and C (forming a triangle)\n* A triangle never has more than one complex subwave, in which case it is always a zigzag combination or a triangle.\n\nGuidelines:\n\n* Usually, wave C subdivides into a zigzag combination that is longer lasting and contains deeper percentage retracements than each of the other subwaves\n* Sometimes, wave D subdivides into a zigzag combination that is longer lasting and contains deeper percentage retracements than each of the other subwaves\n* Sometimes one of the waves, usually wave C, D, or E, subdivides into a contracting or barrier triangle. Often the effect is as if the entire triangle consisted of nine zigzags\n* About 60% of the time, wave B does not end beyond the start of wave A. When it does, the triangle is called a running triangle\n\n*Barrier Triangle*\n\n* A barrier triangle has the same characteristics as a contracting triangle except that waves B and D end at essentially the same level\n* When wave 5 follows a triangle, it is typically either a brief, rapid movement or an exceptionally long extension\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Expanding Triangle*\n\nRules:\n\nMost rules are the same as for contracting triangles, with these differences:\n\n* Wave C, D, and E each moves beyond the end of the preceding semi-directional subwave (The result is that going forward in time, a line connecting the ends of waves B and D diverges from a line connecting the ends of waves A and C)\n* Subwaves B, C and D each retrace at least 100% but no more than 150% of the preceding subwave\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGuidelines:\n\nMost guidelines are the same as well, with these differences:\n\n* Subwaves B, C and D usually retrace 105 to 125% of the preceding subwave\n* No subwave has yet been observed to subdivide into a triangle\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/53rxncxrioo61.png?width=382&format=png&auto=webp&s=ae29668a9d4f7d135c89dcb19c875b40ee44962d\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Triangles are probably my favourite setup to trade](https://preview.redd.it/spe2jfdtioo61.png?width=414&format=png&auto=webp&s=700771d35c77fe6c960367bfb9e6570480143673)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[A triangle setup I identified a few weeks ago](https://preview.redd.it/ktfa7u0vioo61.png?width=1154&format=png&auto=webp&s=1cdf556c2dc50b97904005704e810640caac799a)\n\n*Combinations*\n\nRules:\n\n* Combinations comprise two or three corrective patterns seperated by one or two corrective patterns in the opposite direction, labeled as X (The first corrective pattern is labeled W, the second Y and the third, if there is one, Z)\n* A zigzag combination comprises two or three zigzags (in which case it is called a double or triple zigzag)\n* A \"double three\" flat combination comprises (in order) a zigzag and a flat, a flat and a zigzag, a flat and a flat, a zigzag and a triangle or a flat and a triangle\n* A rare \"triple three\" flat combination comprises three flats\n* Double and triple zigzags take the place of zigzags and double and triple threes take the place of flats and triangles\n* An expanding triangle has yet to be observed as a component of a combination\n\nGuidelines:\n\n* When a zigzag or flat appears too small to be the entire wave with respect to the preceding wave (or if it is to be wave 4, the preceding wave 2) a combination is likely.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3um07vx6joo61.png?width=963&format=png&auto=webp&s=f3d51146b3d7e3115744a59d6b0dbe8fb11655d7\n\n**General Advice For Using Elliot Waves**\n\n* The best approach is deductive reasoning. By knowing what Elliot rules will not allow, you can deduce that whatever remains is the proper perspective\n* Have a preferred count and an alternative count - Its important not to be biased when trading!\n* Always invest with the preferred count - until proven wrong!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI just want to leave this last note as well:\n\nThe trick to trading is to notice that it is all just waves within waves. Patterns within patterns. Whether it is on the 1 minute time frame, the 1 hour, or the 1 month. The patterns are the same, just of different amplitudes. The bigger the time frame, the more important the pattern. The same could be said of life really. Shit happens, but its only one event in the grand scheme of things. Zoom out if you need to. And if that doesn't help - Zoom out again.\n\nNathMcLovin!","created_utc":"2021-03-22 21:20:37","num_comments":43,"score":281,"upvote_ratio":0.88,"is_original_content":false,"permalink":"/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mb35i6/elliot_wave_theory_an_introduction_part_3/","title":"Elliot Wave Theory - An Introduction!

{"_id":{"$oid":"605bb2f45df7eedfb49c1db5"},"id":"mb2mjb","fullname":"t3_mb2mjb","selftext":"Hey guys I just wanted to share with you a company that I think can be a 10x stock in less than 5 years. The ticker is AMRS.\n\nAmyris is a biotech company that has figured out a way to bioengineer the DNA of yeast bacteria in order to produce any naturally occurring molecule found in nature. Normally yeast consumes sugar to produce ethanol, but Amyris has found a way to feed the yeast sugar cane and produce any molecule they want. Not only can they produce any molecule they want, but they can scale the molecules to commercial 200,000 liter fermentation tanks. Ok cool, so they can make molecules, big deal, what does this actually mean? Well this is where it gets interesting. These molecules that they are creating, are disrupting and replacing traditional molecules that are harvested from plants or produced from fossil fuels. Some of these ingredients include, Reb M, (replacing sugar and stevia), Vanillin (replacing vanilla flavor), Squalane (replacing Squalane which is used in lotions/skin care products), CBG (replacing CBD because it is more effective). This is just a few in the 18 molecules they have in the current pipeline.\n\nOk cool, so they can replace traditional molecules/ingredients, big deal? But thing is, it IS a big deal. Amyris is able to replace these traditional molecules because they are able to do it at a cheaper cost because they use sugar cane waste from sugar cane plantations, they are able to do it at large commercial scale, and they are able to produce the molecules even purer than traditional means.\n\n This industry is in its infancy still but bioengineering bacteria hosts to produce chemistry is the future of the materials industry, especially as resources become more scarce and demand for sustainable ingredients/molecules increase. The company currently produces 3-4 molecules each year at scale (industrial fermentation tanks) and has 12 molecules currently being produced and sold. Not to mention (450) molecules in the pipeline ready to take to market when the time is right.\n \nWhat they are doing is extremely smart right now. They are creating their own consumer brands and using the ingredients that they bioengineer to sell to the consumer for super high markup. They are able to make 50-60% gross profit margin on these products... This is an insane amount of profit on sale.. They already have 3 consumer brands and are launching 5 more this year. They plan to get each brand to a billion dollar valuated company...\n\nNow, here is where it gets interesting. They are using the profits from the consumer brand sales to fund the growth into the ingredient sales business... This is huge because this will allow them to build more manufacturing facilities to be able to produce more chemicals for more companies willing to sell them. These other companies have to pay Amyris for the ingredients out right, pay them royalties, OR license out the molecules (kind of like a software license). It's kind of like how tesla started. They started with extremely expensive electric sports car, had to sell a bunch of these at a high markup so they could afford to grow and build mass market vehicles for the everyday person.\n\nOh yeah and did I mention that Amyris is the only one of it's biotech peers that will be profitable this year and be able to self fund all of it's growth going forward?\n\nThis company is disrupting the chemical materials industry and IS THE FUTURE of the synthetic biology industrial revolution.\n\nIf you want to learn more about this company there are a few great videos that explain what the company is doing. The analyst, Graham Tanaka has some videos of the interview with the CEO and the VP of R&D here:\n\nhttps://tanaka.com/news-%26-research\n\nI also recommend you listen to the recent conference call webcasts and earnings calls on the IR page on their website:\n\nhttps://investors.amyris.com/events-and-presentations","created_utc":"2021-03-22 20:53:32","num_comments":127,"score":64,"upvote_ratio":0.65,"is_original_content":false,"permalink":"/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mb2mjb/amrs/","title":"AMRS","author":"mynameeejefff","firstseen":"2021-03-24 21:45:24.863562"}

In with another PLTR DD.\n\nI'll briefly touch on some financial aspects (will try to include as little technicalities as possible - we won't be making our own DCF/EVA/Multiple Valuation, calculating a WACC and levering and de-levering betas here but there'll be some numbers - soz).\n\nMainly I want to touch on the misconception that Palantir is not profitable and that they're losing more and more money year by year. I'll try to show why Aunt Cathie, Vanguard and Soros Fund Management aren't actually high.\n\n>*ThEy'Ve BeEn ArOuNd FoR 17 YeArS aNd ArE sTiLl NoT pRoFiTaBlE*\n\nBuckle up boomer.\n\nBefore we get to that I want to briefly discuss the current market environment and the potential for further dips (potentially even dips of dips of dips a.k.a. megadips) in the near future as to inform some of you newer YOLOers about what this whole 10 YR Treasury Yield shit is all about and why you should care. It might potentially save you some money. If you're familiar with the inverse correlation of growth stock prices and the treasury yields/inflation expectations, just skip ahead.\n\nAt the end I'd like to compare PLTR's current situation with industry peers and compare their forecasted developments.\n\n# Valuation of Growth Stocks & 10 YR Treasury Yield\n\nNow why is Palantir dipping more than other tech stocks like Apple or Google? Was it just a pump and dump? Are people leaving? To answer that question we'll have to look at how people valuate companies. The most widely used method is the Discounted Cash Flow method. In simplified terms you look at a company's future cash flows, discount them at some interest rate, add some fancy terminal value and what not (don't worry about that) and you end up with the current company's valuation.\n\n[This is a simplified version of the DCF valuation - you can get all fancy with this](https://preview.redd.it/vkpao2965no61.png?width=524&format=png&auto=webp&s=1888f4c171b6a8dea8bd03574556e9c7d8299d39)\n\nNow when treasury rates rise - the discount rate (r) rises - your Cashflow gets smaller. The further out in the future your cashflows are - the more you're affected by rising interest rates. Hence why companies with valuations based on cashflows that are far out are more strongly affected by those rising rates. The big Cash Flows are a few years out and are being discounted at (1+r) \\^ many years.\n\nBelow you'll see how MSFT, GOOGL & AAPL's market caps are a lot less affected than newer companies such as Tesla (moderately new), PLTR and Snowflake - they're all \"tech\" stocks but tech  **‚â†** same growth expectations for all tech companies.\n\n[Inverse Correlation between Growth Stocks & Treasury Yields](https://preview.redd.it/kzn6lnyd7no61.png?width=1344&format=png&auto=webp&s=55f12416a459f10e1c0751111d9d1172835e38d2)\n\n**TLDR**: If treasury yields continue to rise we might see growth stock prices go even lower due to people valuating these stocks at a lower price due to the increasing discount rate (r). That's just a little disclaimer I wanted to get out of the way - the macroeconomic environment matters a whole lot for these stocks.\n\nNow let's get to the sawwssee\n\n# PLTR Revenue Expectations vs. Peers\n\nSome numbers incoming - bear with me it'll get better.\n\nSo this one's pretty straightforward. Palantir increased their revenues by 47% between FY 2019 and FY 2020. The revenues from government operations in 2018 accounted for 43% (255m $) of total revenues, commercial revenue accounted for 57% (340m $) - In 2020 Government revenues accounted for 56% (610m $), commercial revenues accounted for 44% (482.5m $) of total revenues.\n\nSo many numbers I know - hold on. Between 2018 and 2020 PLTR had a roughly 150% increase in government revenues and a roughly 40% increase in commercial revenues. Now the good news - we're not even close to being done yet.\n\nHere's a quick take (copy pasta from a  [previous DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ma4b3b/pltr_analyst_ratings_fud_bad_faith_and_abusing/)  I made) on the potential growth of government revenues going forward:\n\n>If they end up getting IL-6 from the DoD - they would be the first private company to ever get that [level of clearance](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2021/1/27/2312271-1611785323344723_origin.png). That could attract other governments' military organisations like the UK, France, Germany etc. (assuming a cooperation with US allies is possible and doesn't jeopardize their current contracts with the US Military).\n\nSo [Palantir state](https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2021/Palantir-Reports-Revenue-Growth-of-47-for-Full-Year-2020-Expects-Q1-2021-Revenue-Growth-of-45) that they're expecting **AT LEAST** 30% YoY growth in FY 2021 and I don't expect Papa Karp to underdeliver. Analysts predict a 35% increase. Now what's even more interesting is that actual profit metrics (EBITDA, EBIT, Net Income) are expected to grow from roughly 50% - 70% respectively - Palantir is going to be profitable very soon (they actually already are - or close to being profitable at least, but more on that later).\n\n[Analyst Forecasts for profitability \\/ growth metrics](https://preview.redd.it/5zrjp184hno61.png?width=749&format=png&auto=webp&s=40a8ac792091fabc1437d07b71a1111321edbf01)\n\nNow you might say \"the price targets are completely off - why trust these analysts when it comes to financial forecasts\" - truth be told, the forecasts on KPIs were a lot more accurate than the PTs. Although they were off by a mile on some of the KPIs (predicted a Net Income of 124 when it was actually 197, I've noticed that analysts have always underestimated those metrics with Palantir - so the following figures might actually end up being a low-ball estimate/bear case) - the mean prediction of revenues was 1072 vs. 1093 actual revenues, so that's pretty accurate.\n\n[Pretty accurate mean revenue estimate - GJ](https://preview.redd.it/vlbdhrnqrno61.png?width=1071&format=png&auto=webp&s=3a26d86c0ceb917476c0f6a9c760bfa32d688915)\n\n# Profitability\n\nOkay - now to Palantir's profitability. I want to dismiss the following kind of comments and have you apes understand why PLTR is Soros Fund Management LLC's 2nd largest position, why it accounts for 21% of Credit Suisse Asset Management LLC's portfolio, why Vanguard is literally just telling Papa Karp to take their money, why Aunt Cathie is all over this stock.\n\n>Keep getting your stocks from Instagram my man.  \n>  \n>It‚Äôs been 20 years without profit but I‚Äôm sure $50B will be a reasonable valuation just around the corner  \n>  \n>\\- Billion dollar investor who does Deep Value plays and identifies companies when they're still in the garage stage\n\n[Stock based compensation 5xed in 2020 compared to 2019 and 2018 - that's what happens when you IPO](https://preview.redd.it/06msu3oukno61.png?width=1151&format=png&auto=webp&s=c0354cc01aa4b5ec4baad220cc0cb7d61aa6177b)\n\nSo look at Datadog, Snowflake, Dynatrace, they all IPO'd between 2019 and 2020. You see how the stock based compensation accounts for a huge chunk of their net loss (Datadog's Stock Price Compensation was 74M$ vs. 24.5M$ net loss - substract that from the net loss and they're actually up 50M$)? That's not the case for mature companies like Adobe -  why's that? u/ugh_stupidpeople explains that pretty nicely [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/PLTR/comments/ll646o/stock_based_compensation/gnnm3fx?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). The gist is that employees get a a percentage of their salaries payed out as shares, when they IPO the following happens (in the PLTR case):\n\n>The higher PLTR's stock price goes, the more its stock-based compensation numbers reported in earnings will increase, until pre-IPO compensation agreements expire. That's because the quantity of shares they're paying their employees was fixed pre-IPO. Higher price x same # of shares = higher cost reported. This will end as those pre-IPO compensation agreements expire.  \n>  \n>If Palantir's stock hadn't tripled since going public, their stock-based comp numbers would be much lower.  \n>  \n>\\- u/ugh_stupidpeople\n\nAll else staying constant - if Palantir had the same Stock Based Compensation as they reported 2019 a.k.a. if they hadn't IPOed - they'd have an adjusted net loss of around 140 mio as opposed to the reported 1.166B$. If you deduct the 241m $ from the reported net loss of 579m $ (= 338m $), the adj. net loss would've been half that, in other words their net income would've increased by 50% not decreased by 100%. Deduct all costs that don't actually affect the operational activities of PLTR (First figure in the revenue section) you actually end up with a positive net income of 197.15M$ - Surprise, Palantir's operational activities are actually profitable, it's just the whole finance overhead (also strategical tax reasons) dragging the reported Net Income down.\n\n>\"BuT YoU'rE JuSt TwIsTiNg ThE NuMbeRs To MaKe It LoOk GoOd\"\n\nIf that's what you're thinking right now, ask yourself if that \"expense\" actually reflects the companies' operational profitability - did it destroy value in any way, is the increasing net loss attributable to bad leadership and a shitty product? It's clearly not. It's just screwing us - the shareholders over in the short run - employees have gotten a disproportionate amount of shares (could Papa Karp have expected the share price to 4x - high of 38$ - or even 3x - current levels - from its IPO valuation in a matter of weeks? Doubt). Those employees are dumping those shares at every fucking spike.\n\nI suspect that's one of the reasons behind Papa Karp's infamous quote \"Fuck off if you're here for the short term gains - we'll be dumping our shares because we're tired of eating ramen every fucking night\".\n\nRemember how the price sky-rocketed to 40ish $ and came crashing down back to the 20s - a big part of that was the lock-in expiring a.k.a. employees cashing in at the top (They actually bought low and sold high, not like some of you apes). This all ends in max. 5 years - the dumping will be a lot less significant though as time goes by - when the pre-IPO Stock Based Compensations will have expired and the employees will be getting a less disproportionate amount of shares in relation to the current market price.\n\nNow the good news is: These stock based compensations are expected to half by next year (see picture above), the profitability margins are expected to rise and the overall numbers are expected to grow - Palantir should be reporting around 320m $ + Net Income and in 5 years those pre-IPO stock compensation agreements will all have expired.\n\n# Some blabber about CoGs, scalability and R&D expenditures (based on 3rd picture - Analyst Forecasts, I'm not gonna label the figures with Fig. 1 etc., we're still just on Reddit)\n\nThe CoGs (Cost of Goods Sold) are expected to stay more or less constant - that's in line with what Papa Karp always said. Palantir's services/products are organised in a way that they can be deployed to more customers without having to spend an amount proportionate to their revenue growth - don't ask me how, I'm not a fucking engineer, check the DD I linked at the bottom of the post if you're into those technicalities. Same goes for companies like Amazon AWS - double the amount of customers, get another server and maybe hire 10% more employees (I don't know the exact figures, as I said, I'm not a fucking engineer but you get the point).\n\nR&D expenditures will grow by 40% and 20% in FY 2021 and FY 2022 respectively - I like to see that, that means they're investing to create a more competitive product. Consider they've had a pretty hostile relationship with IBM until IBM eventually gave up and partnered with PLTR - now imagine those Apollo/Foundry/Gotham testicles growing even larger.\n\n# Peer Analysis\n\nNow this all sounds pretty nice, is Palantir just giga special, one of a kind? No - the data analytics/data management - basically everything that has to do with data industry is growing like there's no tomorrow. Here a few quotes to highlight that (actual scientific literature - I know my brain hurts too, we're done soon):\n\n>The size of the digital universe was roughly 130 billion gigabytes in 1995. By 2020, this number will swell to 40 trillion gigabytes.  \n>  \n>\\- Professor Murtaza Haider (Professor of Data Science)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>By 2018, the United States alone could face a shortage of 140,000 to 190,000 people with deep analytical skills as well as 1.5 million managers and analysts with the know-how to use the analysis of big data to make effective decisions  \n>  \n>\\- McKinsey Global Institute\n\nOkay, so there'll be exponentially more data year by year, we can gain insights from that data to improve our business decisions and save a literal fuck ton of money by doing so. [Airbus for example claims](https://skywise.airbus.com/en/about-skywise.html) that they've managed to speed up their A350 production process by 33% just by using PLTR's services. Now that's deep fucking value - not u/DeepFuckingValue deep fucking value I mean actual deep fucking value - literal millions/billions saved.\n\n[So here are the forecasted Revenue Growths for PLTR's industry peers](https://preview.redd.it/f229ofiqvno61.png?width=1088&format=png&auto=webp&s=1dac321953bfd0559e3249df594f81cd2dcfb466)\n\nNow see, when Papa Karp says 30% annual growth and Jefferie's says 40% annual growth - they're not actually high, that industry is just growing at an abnormal pace. By the end of FY 2023 PLTR's revenues (according to analyst estimates and assuming Papa Karp's 30% YoY growth) will have increased by 127% - crazy right? Well - Snowflake's projected to grow by 388% (although I'm a bit skeptical about that one). So on a Peer Median (92.3%) Palantir's 127% revenue growth doesn't actually sound too absurd (Snowflake 388% on the other hand - not sure).\n\nSnowflake does have an impressive track record when it comes to their revenue growth (3x their revenues from 2018-2019, almost 3x from 2019-2020) hence why they have that valuation. However they're growing from a significantly smaller base than PLTR (roughly 60% of PLTR's revenues in FY 2020). Now remember the first topic we touched on? Higher growth expectations - bigger cash flows being further in the future: That might explain why Snowflake's Stock Price took a larger hit than PLTR with the rising treasury yields.\n\nLet's talk about the current valuation based on the Price to Sales Ratio - Consider the recently IPO'd companies (Datadog, DynaTrace, Palantir and Snowflake) - forget about SolarWinds for a second.\n\nThey all have P/S Ratios between 21 and 105 (Snowflake lul). My point being: PLTR is not grossly overvalued, they'll grow into that valuation. If all goes according to plan and assuming the market cap stays constant, which obv it won't - PLTR will have a P/S Ratio of under 20 with the current valuation. Close to Adobe with a P/S ratio of 16.85.\n\n*SolarWinds is at a P/S ratio of 5, that's partly due to them being hacked which pretty much a.) fucked their growth in FY 2020 and for the following years and b.) people dumping their stock after the hacks were medialised (Share price of 25$ on December 11th - down to 14$ December 18th).*\n\nTo get back to the profitability part real quick, after that you're dismissed - Datadog, Dynatrace and Snowflake - the new kids on the block - all reported a negative Net Income for 2020 and they've all been around for at least a decade. (Snowflake founded 2012 - soz) Amazon was founded 1994 and had their first \\*reported\\* profitable year in 2004 - a decade later, that's just how it goes in the software/digital services world apparently.\n\n**Edit:** Soros Fund Management is expected to dump those shares whenever their lock-in expires - [George Soros raised ethical concerns regarding PLTR's modus operandi](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/19/george-soros-is-offloading-palantir-shares-due-to-business-practices.html). That's the same guy who shorted the Thai Baht and the GBP - literally screwing over entire economies - raising ethical concerns about his little 400M$ position in PLTR (Sure dude, nice PR stunt). Them being invested in PLTR since 2012 however shows that they do see some deep value.\n\n**TLDR**: So all that being said - Whilst PLTR is getting a lot of attention in the media and on various other platforms including this subreddit - I personally do not think that PLTR is grossly overvalued. There's some asset inflation due to macroeconomic factors but considering how hot of a topic of discussion PLTR is right now (as compared to Datadog for example), it surprised me that they're not at a higher P/S (example Snowflake P/S 105). Their growth potential is huge but not irrealistic, it seems like they have the scalability figured out. From a purely operational PoV Palantir is profitable, the expenses that make it unprofitable on paper have nothing to do with their product/services, it's just some financial shenanigans - Adjusted Net Profit was positive in FY 2020 and is expected to increase by 66% during FY 2021.\n\nIf the economy doesn't come crashing down in the foreseeable future, this stonk will imo be worth a whole lot more than it is right now. Let's hope that Yellen has some positive fiscal policy news for us today.\n\nTreasury yields are decreasing (1.65% today vs. 1.75% on the 10 YR Treasury Notes a week ago - they might also continue rising). We have a potential catalyst on the 14th of April (Demo Day), quarterly earnings some time in May, so if the macroeconomic factors are with us, we might see a \"recovery\" from the current price levels shortly. In the longer run we'll just have to hope that the economy doesn't come crashing down. Goldman says we're not currently in a bubble, here's a nice read on that topic: [Goldman Sachs Says Global Stock Markets Are Nowhere Near Risky Bubble - Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-22/goldman-says-global-stock-markets-are-nowhere-near-risky-bubble), make your own opinion.\n\nI'll post it again - I really liked u/ada_diamonds take [Former PLTR Engineer DD Part #2: Usability, Deployabilty, Scalability, & Submersibility + My Lockup Plan : PLTR (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/PLTR/comments/lknie3/former_pltr_engineer_dd_part_2_usability/) \\- I can't tell you why PLTR is different from the other suppliers like he can (Predictive analytics, incomplete datasets something something) so go check that DD out if you haven't already.

As for how fast Chase orders are, I could not find any information. For those with more money, IBKR Pro seems to make sense especially with really low margin rates.\n\nI assume the brokerages that posted their execution speeds are ones that are confident they are far above average.\n\nAlso, do keep in mind there's also stuffs like price improvement, execution price, effective spread, etc. to take into account. I just wanted to sum up some of the brokerages.\n\nI use Fidelity as my main brokerage and I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT. Fidelity #1.

This is my DD on NAPA and I am not a financial advisor, nor do I press trade for you. I hope you enjoy!\n\n**The Company**\n\nNAPA became publicly tradeable last week on March 18th, 2021 at a share price of $15. They issued 20 million shares, with 13.3 million shares offered by NAPA and 6.6 million shares offered by its existing stockholders. \n\nNAPA‚Äôs business model is a luxury wine production company with 8 massive vineyards that are the backbone of the model. Their mission is to have Duckhorn Portfolio wines poured and enjoyed wherever fine wines are served throughout the world. They have existed for over 40 years and they have had over 40 successful harvests in the Napa Valley.  Today, The Duckhorn Portfolio is one of North America‚Äôs premier luxury wine companies, with ten renowned wine brands, eight state-of-the-art wineries, 843 coveted acres spanning 22 sustainably farmed Estate vineyards, over 400 diverse and talented employees, passionate consumers in every state and more than 50 countries and over 55,000 loyal wine club members who eagerly await each new shipment of our wines.\n\n**Company Statements**\n\nWe sell our wines in all 50 states and over 50 countries at suggested retail prices (‚ÄúSRPs‚Äù) ranging from $20 to $200 per bottle under a world-class luxury portfolio of brands, including Duckhorn Vineyards, Decoy, Kosta Browne, Goldeneye, Paraduxx, Calera, Migration, Canvasback, Greenwing and Postmark. We are the largest pure-play luxury wine supplier and the eleventh largest wine supplier by sales value overall in the United States according to IRI for the twelve months ended October 4, 2020.\n\nOur wines have consistently commanded leading market positions in their respective categories and are appealing to a broad consumer base from renowned wine critics to casual wine drinkers. We are the only wine producer this century to have two brands in its portfolio that have won the prestigious Wine of the Year award from *Wine Spectator* magazine, and we also boast the number one selling luxury cabernet sauvignon in the United States since 2017 according to sales value data from IRI. Another testament to our portfolio strength is the nearly 100,000 consumers who traveled to at least one of our seven renowned tasting rooms located throughout California and Washington for one of our luxury wine experiences in 2019.\n\n**Nitty Gritty Analysis**\n\n1) Market Cap, NAPA has a 2.23B market cap which is calculated by share price X # of outstanding shares. This places NAPA in a mid-cap company which are typically expected to experience rapid growth. Usually, mid-cap companies are in the process of seeking funding and expanding. This entails a higher risk for any investor because they are not established like a large-cap company, but I am attracted to this stock for the potential growth. \n\n2) Revenue, NAPA is an emerging growth company, and they are only required to present two years of financial statements and two years of related analysis. Here are some highlights of their financial success, 500% net sales growth since 2010, 18% net sales 5-year CAGR (compound annual growth rate), #1 largest pure play U.S. luxury wine company, 11 years of consecutive organic growth, 9% average net income margin, and \\~40% average adjusted EBITDA margin. \n\nThe P/S ratio for NAPA currently is 0.4259 which is calculated by dividing the number of outstanding shares 115.05M by their sales last year of $270.6M. The operating margin is another good sign. They have been maintaining about 24% operating margin the past two years. Operating margin is calculated by operating income divided by total revenue. \n\nüì∑\n\n$153.2 million increase in net sales from Fiscal 2015 to Fiscal 2020, representing an approximately 18% CAGR. \n\n$22.8 million increase in net income from Fiscal 2015 to Fiscal 2020, representing an approximately 28% CAGR.\n\n$56.7 million increase in adjusted EBITDA from Fiscal 2015 to Fiscal 2020, representing an approximately 17% CAGR.\n\nHighly attractive adjusted EBITDA margin profile, averaging approximately 40% between Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2020.\n\nEBITDA margin is at calculated by taking EBITDA of divided by total revenue and it showcases the company‚Äôs financial performance. Sitting around 40% isn‚Äôt the most attractive for a stock but since this is a wine stock and they own vineyards it is common to see in farms high depreciation, interests, tax, and amortization.\n\n**Competitors**\n\nIt is hard to say how NAPA will place in this market since they are the largest luxury wine seller in the U.S. but comparing it to the wine market, big names like STZ-B Constellation B go for $245.00 a share. I am not going to divulge into too much of the competition you can do some research on that if you want to. \n\n**Management**\n\nThe president, Alex Ryan has maintained his position since 2005 and has taken on other roles including CEO, COBD and he was GM and COO before becoming president. Most of the executive board has been in the company pre-2010. The founders Dan and Margaret Duckhorn are no longer apart of the board, but they look like such lovely old couple that just melts your heart. They have created a successful business that now is publicly traded. \n\nLetter from Alex Ryan CEO,\n\n‚ÄúUnderstanding the evolution of The Duckhorn Portfolio, and the values that have guided us for over 40 years, begins with the vision of our founders, Dan and Margaret Duckhorn. When they established Duckhorn Vineyards in 1976, we were one of just 40 wineries in Napa Valley. Even in those early days, the Duckhorns sought to set themselves apart from the pack. Recognizing that the American palate was developing, they championed Napa Valley Merlot as a standalone varietal wine. It was a bold, daring choice, and one that ultimately established luxury Merlot as one of North America‚Äôs favorite wines.\n\nEven then, in the infancy of our industry, we intuited that American wine had the potential to become part of the fabric of consumers‚Äô lives; that wine is more than just what is in the bottle, it is the promise of an experience, and a source of joyful connection to nature and to each other. Understanding this, the Duckhorns cultivated a commitment to excellence that shapes every facet of our business, from how we sustainably grow grapes and make wine to our commitment to holistically support our employees, engage our guests and enrich the communities in which we live and much more.\n\nA willingness to challenge ourselves, to be daring and innovative and to never rest on past accomplishments is hardwired into our DNA. For 32 years, I have endeavored to create a diverse and inclusive culture that attracts and inspires the most talented people in our industry, and then empowers them to change our Company for the better, which has fueled growth from our debut 1978 vintage of 1,600 cases of wine sold in 1981 to more than 1.4 million cases of wine sold in Fiscal 2020.\n\nPerhaps our greatest point of pride is the fact that as we have grown, we believe our wines and team have only gotten better. As a testament to the pedigree of our acclaimed brands, not only are we the largest and one of the most respected pure-play luxury wine companies in the United States, we are the only wine producer this century to have two brands in its portfolio that have won the prestigious ‚ÄúWine of the Year‚Äù award from *Wine Spectator* magazine.‚Äù\n\n**Risks**\n\nCOVID-19 has not seemed to really impact NAPA as greatly as they expected. They achieved just under their goal of 320 million in sales last year. Their actual sales were 277 million which with COVID being a factor and all 7 vineyards shut down to the public. 43 million is not too far off from the anticipated mark. I believe if their vineyards were open, they could have made that 43 million. \n\nNatural disasters last year were a huge testament to what natural disasters can do. The wildfires in California were massive and although no farm of NAPA was burnt, they could still affect the grapes and how they grow. We will not see how this impact is until later this year during harvest season. \n\nThis is an emerging stock and was just listed on the market. I do not think it has quite placed itself on the market and could be volatile over the next couple weeks. Due to this factor, I have multiple buy in points planned out over the next couple weeks. I want to watch were it places first.\n\n**Expectations**\n\nI am a new investor of only a year, and this is my first in depth DD so sorry if this is not the best. I do expect NAPA to do very well looking at the financial statements, sec reports, their website, business model, and I just like the stock. In this market it is harder to go off of older style DD but I truly believe this is the way when valuing a new stock on the market. I expect a big catalyst for this stock is when they can open the vineyards back to the public when COVID starts dying down. They are not just producing a product and selling it they also are a service industry for travel and tourism. Bottom line is that I will be investing into this company and I‚Äôll even try some of the wine soon. \n\n**Citation**\n\n**\\*Some of this information is not my words and where I got it from was:**\n\n**https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21- 067554/d90982ds1a.htm#rom90982\\_13**\n\n[**https://www.marketwatch.com/story/5-things-to-know-about-napa-valleys-duckhorn-wine-ipo-11615946138**](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/5-things-to-know-about-napa-valleys-duckhorn-wine-ipo-11615946138)\n\n**https://www.duckhornportfolio.com/**","created_utc":"2021-03-22 17:36:50","num_comments":42,"score":44,"upvote_ratio":0.75,"is_original_content":false,"permalink":"/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mayn5g/napa_duckhorn_portfolio_inc_dd/","title":"NAPA (Duckhorn Portfolio Inc) DD","author":"Krispy303","firstseen":"2021-03-24 21:45:24.866839"}

So I decided to make this post to help you autists sharpen your crayons and actually use them for a greater purpose than just as snacks to eat in between buying calls on whatever stock is hot for the day.\n\nElliot Waves are a theory that markets move in stages of a theoretical \"2 steps forward, one step back\" type movement (in this case 5 advances with 3 pullbacks, usually followed by 2 declines with 1 advance). They were first observed and described in the mid 1900's. For more background info, and a full description of Elliot waves, their history and uses, and applications, I would advise everyone to read \"Elliot wave Principles: Key to market behaviour\" by A.J. Frost and Robert Prechter. You can access this for free at [https://z-lib.org/](https://z-lib.org/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis post will outline a summary of Rules and Guidelines for Elliot Waves:\n\n**Motive Waves**\n\n*Impulse:*\n\nRules:\n\n* An impulse wave always subdivides into 5 waves\n* Wave 1 always subdivides into an impulse or (rarely) a diagonal\n* Wave 3 always subdivides into an impulse\n* Wave 5 always divides into an impulse or diagonal\n* Wave 2 always subdivides into a zigzag, flat or combination\n* Wave 4 always subdivides into a zigzag, flat, triangle or combination\n* Wave 2 never moves beyond the start of wave 1\n* Wave 3 always moves beyond the end of wave 1\n* Wave 3 is never the shortest wave\n* Wave 4 never moves beyond the end of wave 1\n* Never are waves 1, 3 and 5 all extended\n\nGuidelines:\n\n* Wave 4 will almost always be a different corrective pattern than wave 2\n* Wave 2 is usually a zigzag or zigzag combination\n* Wave 4 is usually a flat, triangle or flat combination\n* Sometimes wave 5 does not move beyond the end of wave 3 (in which case it is called a truncation)\n* Wave 5 often ends when meeting or slightly exceeding a line drawn from the end of wave 3 that is parallel to the line connecting the ends of waves 2 and 4\n* The centre of wave 3 almost always has the steepest slope of any equal period within the parent impulse except that sometimes an early portion of wave 1 (the kickoff) will be steeper\n* Wave 1, 3, or 5 is usually extended (an extension appears \"stretched\" because its corrective waves are small compared to its impulse waves. It is substantially longer and contains larger sub-divisions than the non-extended waves\n* Often the extended subwave is the same number (1, 3 or 5) as the parent wave\n* Rarely do two subwaves extend, although it is typical for waves 3 and 5 both to extend when they are of Cycle or Supercycle degree and within a fifth wave of one degree higher\n* Wave 1 is the least commonly extended wave\n* When wave 3 is extended, waves 1 and 5 tend to have gains related by equality or the Fibonnaci ratio\n* When wave 5 is extended, it is often in Fibonnaci proportion to the net travel of waves 1through 3\n* When wave 1 is extended, it is often in Fibonnaci proportion to the net travel of waves 3 through 5\n* Wave 4 typically ends when it is within the price range of subwave four of 3\n* Wave 4 often subdivides the entire impulse into Fibonnaci proportions in time and/or price\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSome basic examples:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r6y4thssbno61.png?width=1542&format=png&auto=webp&s=2315d92b6e53c7a604e994d9a18de6fbe1101f1f\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7vrvhq2ubno61.png?width=660&format=png&auto=webp&s=dbb5e80e776622c8809fdac02f64e9db5d87369c\n\nIn the next part I will give the rules and guidelines for diagonals, along with the start of the corrective wave patterns.

I'm about to give an explanation of what I think is going to happen.  Even the smoothest of brains should be able to at least somewhat understand it.  Now, I know that most of you idiots descend to a near comatose state when you see deep technical anal, or really anything with meaningful content, so let's just talk about card games.\n\nHow do casinos make money on poker?  For each hand of poker played, the casino takes a small percentage of the pot, which is called the rake.  The casino provides the establishment and the dealers, the players play, and the casino takes its commission.  Okay, great, but what the fuck does this have to do with GME?  We're getting there.  Hang on.  The edging is real, but you'll get your payoff.\n\nSo the casino takes its cut from each pot.  The more money in the pot, the more money the casino makes.  Great.  How do they maximize profits?  Well, they can bring in more players, get players to play longer, deal more hands per hour, and/or increase the average size of the pots.  I'm not going to answer how they accomplish most of these, because it doesn't matter.  What matters is that the casinos are incentivized to do these things in order to increase their gains.  The point here is that you don't need to understand poker to understand how the casino makes money, you just need to understand their business model.\n\nLet's focus on how to increase the average size of the pots.  There are tons of ways to do this, but let's assume that instead of being in a giant casino, you're at a local back-alley gambling spot.   Their operation isn't super sophisticated.  They just install a few of their cronys into each game.  Each idiot has roughly the same set of goals: bring people in, loosen up the tables, and create big pots.   As long as the gangsters don't put too much money on the table (and lose it), the house will profit.\n\nThere's one key point here that I haven't mentioned yet.  No one can know that the game is crooked or else they wouldn't play and the house wouldn't make money, right?  Well, that's not entirely true.  In fact, it's not at all true.  Then why the fuck did I mention it?  Well, you tell me, why the fuck would you play a rigged game?\n\nEven if the game is rigged and the players know that it's a sham, if it's the best opportunity for people to expand their wealth, they will still play.  Not all of them, but a lot of them.  In fact, it's even a good thing for the house when \"dumb money\" make money; this brings them back and maybe even brings in some of their friends.  They just aren't allowed to make too much too consistently.\n\nThe house wants you to play.  The house wants your friends to play.  The house wants everyone to play.  So how do you make sure that as many people as possible play?  Did you fucking read the last paragraph?  It's simple: you make it the best way for anyone to make money.  You essentially force them to play.  Don't get lost in the details.   It doesn't matter how this is accomplished.  They can lick you, suck you, fuck you, beat you, squeeze you, whack the other competition off, etc.  All that matters is that whatever game they run, it is the best way for you to try to make it out of wage slavery.\n\nSo what happens when players make too much money?  I don't know, what happens when there's a bug in your favorite game's code?  What happens when the sheep start misbehaving?  A short sighted boss may blame the players or the bug or the sheep, but the astute mobster knows that their fucking minions are to blame.  Again, the game is rigged, and  the minions have one fucking job: follow the script and don't get too greedy.  Any problem, and I mean any problem, is easy to ignore so long as the right wheels are greased and it's not loud enough to annoy the whole fucking neighborhood.  \n\nReddit is an enormous echo chamber.  Shit gets loud in here, but as much as your tiny minds focus on GME, most of the world does not give a flying fuck and even if this news gets big, they're not going to care.  They're too tired and poor to focus on some group of retarded apes hitting the lottery.\n\nSo what the hell am I actually saying about GME?  The apes and their ancestors discovered a loophole in the financial system that was being abused, but this time the minions went too far and the apes realized that they finally have the winning hand.  There's going to be a song and dance and threats and probably some suicides and even some \"Epsteins,\" but as long as the apes don't fold, the apes win this round.  If the mobsters play this game right, they'll fold this hand, take their losses, and (as usual) end up winning in the long run.  They just have to patch the system a bit and wait for people to forget some stuff.  This is EZ mode.\n\nDo you know what happens in the mafia when a handful of its members threatens the entire fucking money making machine?  It doesn't matter if you're a friend of the family, a bigly minion, or even the fucking godfather.  You live by the sword, you die by the sword.  When you have an infected limb, you first try to treat it, but if that doesn't work, you cut that shit off.  These people are fucking cannibals and they don't mind eating their own--I'm sure that some of them even prefer it.  The shorters are going to get thrown into the meat grinder, and the cannibals are going to feast.\n\nTL;DR Read the fucking post.  It took me way longer to write than it will take (most of) you to read it.\n\nHere's some   üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ  üíé üôåüèª   üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ  since half of you autists need these to get off.\n\nEdit: Some of you are taking the poker analogy too literally.  It's an oversimplification, in several ways, but the core argument still HODLs.  Apes will win, some mobsters will get swallowed up.","created_utc":"2021-03-22 16:58:36","num_comments":695,"score":8096,"upvote_ratio":0.94,"is_original_content":false,"permalink":"/r/wallstreetbets/comments/maxt80/gme_poker_cannibalism_and_why_the_apes_are_going/","title":"GME: Poker, cannibalism, and why the apes are going to win this hand.","author":"the_fucking_doctor","firstseen":"2021-03-24 21:45:24.868603"}

I left an explanation of the difference between the two at the bottom.\n\nAward winning company, deals with big names, and new partnership with Walmart marketplace?\n\nYES PLEASE!\n\n**What am I expecting? Lets first take a look at the options chain.**\n\n[Notice the OI on these April call contracts.](https://preview.redd.it/8y3p311dqmo61.png?width=1416&format=png&auto=webp&s=9663c36987554a5a35bb79e48276d4dc2ab9e0f7)\n\n[Now look at the OI on these may contracts.](https://preview.redd.it/1ljxby7pqmo61.png?width=1467&format=png&auto=webp&s=a8f174e6ea5317d59c1ba9d1d3ec810e58641b6c)\n\nIf BIGC was ever going to squeeze, it would be this month. Tons of contracts waiting to go ITM.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xxe9x5lk7no61.png?width=706&format=png&auto=webp&s=8a8958c2e2a0edee884358db09ad71ddc4e901fd\n\n**The BULL CASE:**\n\n**Earnings:**\n\nSince BIGC's IPO it has **consistently beat the earnings estimates set forth** by wall street **INCREASING IN REVENUE EACH TIME**. Lets look at the prices they were trading at during each beat:\n\n9/9/20 - trading at 100's\n\n11/5/20 - trading at mid-80's ??\n\n2/22/21 - trading high 60's?????\n\nAs of the time I'm writing this the stock price is 56.69???????????!!! It makes absolutely no sense as to why this stock is trading so low given it's past trading prices and continuous earnings beats.\n\n**Technical Analysis:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5t6eo3qlxmo61.png?width=409&format=png&auto=webp&s=16e3b1c3d7c7e2e49548a3aa3ec34b4d70f19eb2\n\n1. Clear as day inverse head and shoulders\n2. Very nice bounce off of previous support (First shoulder - WHICH LEFT A HUGE BOTTOMING TAIL ON HUGE VOLUME)\n3. higher low from head to second shoulder\n4. Huge green candle on a reversal doji\n5. huge relative strength to market selloff on witching day close\n\nJust look at yday (quad witching) and today and which candles had volume. Specifically look at the EOD candles and compare them to the overall market. On Quad-Witching close, it resisted the sell off EOD very well with NARROW HUGE VOLUME candles, which I can only assume to be bullish. (see above)\n\n**Analysts:**\n\nI believe that analysts are starting to flip the switch to bullish. Watching the price carefully the past few weeks I believe that insane accumulation / covering is going on.\n\nLETS LOOK AT THE 2 MOST RECENT ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES + MY THOUGHTS\n\n**FOLLOW THE CIRCLES**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jgluwnuv3no61.png?width=1464&format=png&auto=webp&s=b3dadb59c7a465eff435c85a0410132c6387d181\n\n1. ER BEAT AND FELL\n2. DEAL WITH WALMART ANNOUNCED (bought up)\n3. **Upgrade - KeyBanc Capital Markets - Sector Weight ‚Üí Overweight - $75**\n   1. THEY ALREADY ACCUMULATED ON THAT DIP SO THEY LET OUT AN UPGRADE\n4. Market fell recently, that was the dip (which was bought up straight away) - look at SPY\n5. **Initiated - JP Morgan - Neutral - $55**\n   1. possible that they accumulated both on bubble 2 and 4.\n\nMatch these series of events up with the TA in the section above and it checks out for a move higher!\n\nI just wanted to write something short on why I think BIGC is going to rip. RISKY AND THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE!!\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**EDIT: DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SHOP AND BIGC:**\n\nSo I'll explain it in the way that I understand the differences. They do NOT have the same target audience although they have some overlap.\n\n**Simply put** \\- SHOP likes startups (people like you and me if we wanted to get into an ecommerce business), and BIGC likes established businesses. SHOP has more volume of customers, but BIGC deals with clients at an enterprise level and makes a lot more per client. Say SHOP can make 3000/yr off an individuals store, BIGC can make hundreds of thousands /yr off of 1 client.\n\n**Bit more in depth** \\-\n\n**How SHOP makes money**\n\n1. Monthly Subscriptions in tiers\n2. Commission per sale\n3. Credit Card Fees\n\nAgain, SHOP is great for small individuals - easy service + quick store creation for fast sales.\n\n**How BIGC makes money**\n\nBIGC\n\n1. Monthly Subscriptions\n   1. This is their main income - As their client's business grows, they automatically upgrade the client's subscription tier (from what I understand).\n2. Less Commission per sale\n3. Smaller CC Fees\n\nFaster service to help clients manage their stores (code-wise and whatever else). Say a client needed to change significant things about their site / data collection - requiring a couple hundred lines of code - BIGC is more suited to help with that. Cheaper for enterprises that already sell in large volumes (less in commissions than SHOP).\n\n**Where clients overlap and where they differ**\n\nIn terms of small businesses, BIGC can absolutely eat into SHOP's clientele based on the needs of that business. Where it differs is, SHOP isn't designed to benefit huge enterprises who already have huge volumes of sales and don't want to pay commission per sale. \\*\\*In this case SHOP CANNOT hold a candlelight to BIGC's huge clientele ,\\*\\*simply due to how their infrastructure is set up. Tech + cost wise, BIGC will be the choice between the two for a large business.\n\nHope that answers your question.","created_utc":"2021-03-22 16:54:25","num_comments":35,"score":0,"upvote_ratio":0.5,"is_original_content":false,"permalink":"/r/wallstreetbets/comments/maxpw0/underrated_opportunity_bigcommerce_bigc_squeeze/","title":"Underrated Opportunity - BigCommerce (BIGC) Squeeze","author":"Studio24BeYourself","firstseen":"2021-03-24 21:45:24.869249"}

Basically if you buy a 10 year treasury for $90 and hold it until maturity, you get a 1.11% annual yield. You absolutely can't go tits up with this unless you bought a North Korean or Turkish Bonds.\n\nIn this case, it becomes the price of money. No one is willing to go lower than the 1.11% yield unless they hate money. For mortgages, loans and all sorts of businesses, this is the theoretically cheapest anyone can borrow, since no one has better credit or liquidity as the US government.\n\nIn the case of tech stocks, some boomer back in the day decided to value stocks (which provide dividends) as a perpetual bond. The formula for that is P = Coupon/Risk Free Rate. Tech stocks are especially sensitive to this, since the Coupon (returning earnings to shareholders, but you can argue buybacks should be this) is basically 0. Say if $100 = $1/1% is the current \"boomer valuation.\" If yields go up only 1% (which isn't that out of place), technically the stock price is supposed to be cut in half.\n\nThis is also why valuation methods like this don't work for GME or fast growing companies. In any case, this is just a boilerplate valuation method.\n\n*So what next?* The tantrum all started with the [Feb 2021 7-year auction](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/instit/annceresult/press/preanre/2021/R_20210225_3.pdf) with a high yield of 1.195%. What's pesky about treasury auctions is that once the yield/price is set for the the newest issue (the on the run bond), all previous bonds of the same maturity drop in price/increase in yields as less people want it because it is less liquid.\n\n[You can look at historical prices](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/instit/annceresult/annceresult_query.htm) yourself. Remember when you calculate yields with excel, you need to input the coupon values.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dmzm7yx9pmo61.png?width=1432&format=png&auto=webp&s=30b67e8ddd2c754246b3fd644e07f356f9ec6636\n\nThe next auctions are set for this [Thursday](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/instit/instit.htm?upcoming), with a similar size of $62 billion on the 7yr and $61 billion on the 5yr. Why do these tenors matter? Apart from them having a certain amount of influence on the 10yr which drives the economy, they are also beyond JPOW's promise of no rate hikes until 2023. A pesky thing called duration exists in the bond market. Basically yield move\\*duration=inverse move in prices. On zero-coupon and near-zero-coupon bonds like these, the duration is basically the maturity. This means on your new shiny 1.2% 7yr treasury, if in the near term rates go up 1%, you are expected to have a -7% change on the new price that you can sell on the market.\n\nMany bond holders are expecting inflation (and Fed rate increases) to go up in the next few years, and thus are reluctant to buy now, dropping the price and increasing interest rates, which could set off an entire chain of yield re-pricings if JPOW doesn't get off his sorry ass and gets brrrrrrrring.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pi5zvf4jpmo61.png?width=876&format=png&auto=webp&s=bb7d22278b8d19ef9933ec77fa064eab77d590b2\n\nI expect rates to get hotter before we get YCC or some heavy purchases by the Fed. The Fed's actions with ending SLR (thus decreasing the amount of liquidity banks have on hand to do regular short term stuff like commercial paper) and JPOW's disastrously non-~~committal~~brrrrrr interview makes me think the Fed is allowing the market to do its job by tamping down on some exuberance. The first to get hit by hotter rates is absolutely tech. \n\nI have sold the bulk of my tech options and holdings. I currently just have some gold shorts down to $1685 by April.","created_utc":"2021-03-22 15:17:51","num_comments":32,"score":85,"upvote_ratio":0.9,"is_original_content":false,"permalink":"/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mavkie/treasury_issuance_calendar_for_the_next_week_and/","title":"Treasury Issuance Calendar for the Next Week, and why that matters.","author":"1poundbookingfee","firstseen":"2021-03-24 21:45:24.874306"}

In ape language, there is a relatively a small amount of stocks available on the market for fellow apes to buy. **This makes the stock very volatile and able to easily moon** if a lot of Apes buy it. In addition and more importantly, When enzinga asked Matt Ishba(CEO) if he would do an offering(offer more stocks to the float which would decrease it) he responded with \"I'm much more of a long-term holder of the business than a seller.\" \\~ SO NO!!!\n\nI dare you to find any other stock with same float and potential!\n\n2- $UWMC has a massive Gamma squeeze potential if it reaches 10$+ and stays over. The open interest is insane and to put that into perspective, there are 91,835 Calls(I'm only counting the upcoming 2 dates April and May with strikes up to 15$)\\~ **worth 9,183,500 shares which equals Approx 10% of FLOAT if they get exercised!!!** Can you comprehend how insane is that? and I didn't even count all the calls... These are only for the 2 upcoming dates.\n\nBellow is the most recent Call Option Chain (I used Crayons to better illustrate):\n\n[Option Chain April](https://preview.redd.it/vf4kof6aomo61.png?width=683&format=png&auto=webp&s=76c46ed9d9cdae14e4a1c52e1e4aa5bcdde167e9)\n\n[Option Chain May](https://preview.redd.it/vyv4s7ccomo61.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=4ede5f7729a4cf909acfb6a11cdbfea0f96c6d92)\n\n3- Now for the short squeeze potential, This month's short interest hasn't been out yet, but we can try to approximate it by taking a look at the short volume. For the past 5 Business days, **$UWMC had a short volume with an average of 24.288 and on Thursday it was 32.09(Fintel)!!** To put that into perspective, $AMC, a heavily shorted stock, had an average short volume of only 15.24 for the past 5 business days(Fintel). **With this low float and high short volume, this could be a Mars shot passing the Moon...**\n\n[Short Volume](https://preview.redd.it/mt6wenfgomo61.png?width=920&format=png&auto=webp&s=5f33dd04302d321a993a227c1a4bc45ec4868b01)\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\\- Even without the trinity, $UWMC is still an undervalued stock.

Shares available to borrow dropped from **6,700,000** last Tuesday to **200,000** today.\n\nLet's do some quick maths:\n\nTomorrow all shareholders get a special dividend of $1.11 per share.\n\nWith a Public Float of 108.45 mm shares and 39.66 mm shares shorted (as of Feb 26 per Yahoo)\n\nNo we all know a dividend of $1.11 isn't going to scare shorts off. But what I believe will catch them off guard is the Re-Investment of those dividends.\n\nIf EVERYONE re-invests the dividend, that's:\n\n(108.45mm+39.66mm) \\* 1.11 = **$164,402,100**\n\n$164,402,100 / $23.89 (Current Max Pain Price) = **6,881,628** shares of buying power! There are only **200,000** share left to borrow.\n\nThis could make the stock go **PARABOLIC**\n\n# But's I'm a long-term investor, it's a great company, I don't want it to become a MEME stock...\n\nYES YOU DO. Why? Because think about who the retail investors who would be paying attention if/when it goes parabolic. These retail are Millennials and Gen Z. That means they are looking for their first car loans or first home loans! They are College Students and Grad Students, Engineers/ people passionate about creating change. Not only are they the exact demographic that would be Rocket consumers, they are also the exact demographic that Dan Gilbert wants to recruit to Detroit to rebuild Detroit and build the next Amazon!\n\nTake me for example, I'm 32 and looking to buy my first home soon. I was planning to go the traditional route, talk to some banks... blah blah blah. After seeing RKT and reading about Dan Gilbert and Jay Farner, I'll most likely end up using Rocket! Now take me and times that by millions around the world!\n\nBy \"sacrificing\" your dividend (by buying into an undervalued stock... poor you), you would be boosting the value of the rest of your investment by improving the very fundamentals of the company itself. It's a no brainer!\n\n# Don't most people take the dividend as cash?\n\nUnder normal circumstances at a mature company, yes, people take the cash because the company has nothing else to do with the money. This, however, is a **special** dividend. RKT is nowhere near done growing. In fact, they went public in order TO grow. They didn't do it for the cash. This is from an article from when they first went public.\n\n[https://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/2020/08/05/rocket-companies-quicken-loans-ipo/3298571001/](https://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/2020/08/05/rocket-companies-quicken-loans-ipo/3298571001/)\n\n>*Rocket Companies already is the nation's largest mortgage lender. It¬†closed $145 billion in loans in 2019¬†and recorded $893.4 million in profit on revenue of more than $5.1 billion. Gilbert founded the company in 1985. In 2010, he moved its headquarters from the suburbs to downtown Detroit. The company employs some 20,000 across the country with most based in Detroit.*  \n>  \n>***While Quicken's coffers do¬†not necessarily need the capital from an IPO, Gordon said,¬†going public could be a valuable recruiting opportunity¬†for the company competing for young talent in technology and software development. Gordon has had students recruited for positions in Detroit only to be wooed by other firms with offers that include stock options with the potential to grow over time.***  \n>  \n>***\"That‚Äôs a lot easier to do when you‚Äôre a public company,\" he said. \"If anything, it might help Detroit become a little more techy and more attractive to tech people and¬†software people.\"***\n\nDan Gilbert is trying to build the next Amazon... they only STARTED!!\n\nThis dividend was given out to bust the shorts. I'm sure many thought that the ANNOUCEMENT was to bust shorts....no... it's the **Re-Investment** that will bust shorts.\n\nThe Play : Don't just buy options. That doesn't help, you just end up handing the MMs money. If you're not in this already, it should be a 60/40 split on Shares/ Options Or something like that. Obviously since the event is tomorrow, I bought a bunch of weekly options (not a lot compared to my overall investment in RKT), but I can't in good conscious recommend that to anyone, weeklies are just straight gambling. Buy shares! I'm not sure when the best options play would be since I'm not sure when the next catalyst would be, there's a buyback looming, could be anytime.\n\nPositions- 24k shares and calls splattered throughout the options chain.

First off, theroaringkitty handle tweeted at all times of momentum. There seem to be some tweets that are made during declining and inclining MACD histogram bars. Tweets also range when W%R and DMI Convergence/Divergence are at various levels. \n\nRC tweets seem to be tweeted as MACD histogram bars are rising, and RC tweets seem to be tweeted when there is general overbuying (W%R is medium-high). Also, RC tweets seem to usually come when there is a strong signal for an uptrend (+DI and ADX are both high).\n\nElon only tweeted once, but it was literally right before a giant spike in price. There are a few things that I find interesting about this tweet. Volume was very high leading up to the days of this tweet. The +DI to -DI divergence was very high the day before the tweet. Overbuying was very high (high W%R), and the MACD histogram bar doubled in the previous day.\n\nAgain, I don‚Äôt think we can assume causality from any of these tweets, but it is interesting to look at the technical signals leading up to or after a tweet.","created_utc":"2021-03-22 14:18:58","num_comments":13,"score":93,"upvote_ratio":0.8,"is_original_content":false,"permalink":"/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mau8aw/gme_comparing_tweets_using_technical_indicators/","title":"$GME Comparing Tweets Using Technical Indicators.

That means they're against us in getting better access to credit and lower interest rates.\n\nUPST, founded by ex-Google employees, uses AI/ML and alternative data e.g. college degree, geographic, employment history, payment history, job type, etc. basically everything else that can attest to your character and credit worthiness outside of a simple FICO score to create a smarter risk assessment on you and have the banks loan you money and lower interest rates.\n\n>In a 2018 study, Upstart demonstrated to several large U.S. banks that our AI-based lending platform could almost triple their approval rates while holding losses constant compared to their current risk models.  \n>  \n>\\-CEO, David Girouard (4Q2020 Earnings Call on March 5, 2021).\n\nIn other words, by using UPST's smarter credit models, the banks are able to lend out 3X more money without taking on increased risk/exposure on each loan. While FICO scores can be negatively impacted by one or two adverse events, UPST will look beyond what FICO sees to gauge your trustworthiness. Getting screwed by medical bills/insurance will destroy your FICO, but UPST could help the banks see past that and understand you have a solid job, payment history, degree, assets, etc. and get you the credit you need at the fair interest rate you should be getting, counter to what FICO suggests.\n\nThe company also announced on the earnings call of their acquisition of Prodigy Software to enter into the auto lending market. Want a better rate for your next car purchase and not get screwed by FICO? Upstart is making this happen.\n\nThis is the future...it's an amazing company/story/stock and a no-brainer opportunity. Squeeze the short sellers and decrease business' dependency on FICO scores for the betterment of society.\n\nEDIT: \n\n1) Forgot to mention Dan Loeb's Third Point hedge fund and VC arm hold 18.4% of the stock and holding. They participated in the early venture rounds and increase their stake through IPO. With holdings above 10%, they cannot swing trade the stock.

Since nearly everyone is net long, when they get scared they might either paper-hand their longs, or buy lower strike puts.  When their stocks are going up, they might sell higher strike calls (covered calls).  \n\nBut for GME the IV is much higher for the higher strikes.  This could be because:\n\n* Too much demand, either a) apes going bananas or b) people who want to get front-spread (short at the money gamma) needing to buy out the money protection so that they can show their risk manager they don't have unlimited risk.\n* Not enough supply, because no one is going to sell OTM calls since they fear the Planet of the Apes.\n* Price-gouging: because they know the apes are price-insensitive and need their heroine fix, so just jack up the prices, and the apes won't even know it.  \n\nDo whatever you want, I am rooting for the ape army.

The TRA essentially makes it difficult to value a company and to predict earnings accurately, because the TRA liability and expense will depend on factors such as\n\n* The public share price during the partnership share to company share conversion\n* The gross profit of the company during that Q\n* And the applicable tax rate for that company\n\nFor $PRPL, good news is that on Q3 2020, the Pearce brothers had exited and converted 99% of their type B shares in Innohold to PRPL, with 99% of the possible TRA already reflected in the liabilities there won't be much surprises going forward. The not so good news, there's still about 130 MM USD left that will eat into $PRPL earnings the next few quarters.\n\nThe Share conversions and subsequent sales besides triggering the TRA also triggered an incremental loan warrant strike reprice, This is different from the public stock warrants, it is the warrant related to the loan that PRPL received from Coliseum and Blackwell in 2018. They usually put this sort of terms in the loan to prevent founders cashing out early. According to the GAAP Accounting Standards Codification 480,\n\n[https://cpaclass.com/gaap-accounting-standards/codification-400/asc-codification-topic-480.htm](https://cpaclass.com/gaap-accounting-standards/codification-400/asc-codification-topic-480.htm)\n\nyou need to record the fair value of this as a liability. Unlike the TRA, you can calculate the warrant liabilities more accurately, usually they do it using Monte Carlo instead of BSM. Here's an excel sheet that does Monte Carlo pricing though it doesn't account for reprice probability yet\n\n[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1paeexI0jD6mlj9n-me59tS4IPpq3bARJ/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1paeexI0jD6mlj9n-me59tS4IPpq3bARJ/view?usp=sharing)\n\nAnd here's a pdf that details Monte Carlo for warrants\n\n[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aVEblipoBpvz35c\\_Zw0nYl2VzhIxY-TH/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aVEblipoBpvz35c_Zw0nYl2VzhIxY-TH/view?usp=sharing)\n\nThe May 2020 share sales of the Pearce brothers triggered that reprice clause and reset the warrant strike to zero. So for PRPL since the strike is 0 and event reprice probability is over 90% with near DTE, you can just multiple the number of outstanding loan warrants x the current share price to get an accurate estimate. in Q3 2020, it was 24.86 x 2.6 = 64.6 Million. For Q4, since share price have increased further to $31, the warrant liabilities would be 31 x 2.6 = 80.6, a difference of about 16 MM USD from the previous Q. this is reflected in the statements of operations, dragging the EPS lower.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cgq7xp3mklo61.jpg?width=533&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f20a6ba63f7c3e42a8663470e5b22a99df569121\n\n# THE LINK to $GME\n\nAs I was analyzing PRPL, out of curiosity I've tried to find its biggest shorts. $PRPL has very low short interest, at only 4.2% of the shares outstanding.

It was like a betrayal of trust.\" He says that market makers pay so much for order flow because it gives them an exclusive window into where the market is moving. When firms see tons of orders coming in for Tesla, they can purchase shares for their own account, pushing up the EV-maker's prices for their clients when the next flood of orders arrives. \"Order flow is everything,\" he says. \"It tells you where the market is going next. It gives the high-frequency market makers a crystal ball and puts the small investor at a big information disadvantage. Seeing all that order flow gives a market maker information that the public doesn't have.\"..In his example, if the market maker buys XYZ at $50.01 and sells at $50.09, it makes a fat, 8¬¢ spread. But if the firm \"worked the order\" by seeking buyers willing to pay a bit more, it could purchase for on behalf of its client at $50.05, and sell at $50.06. The seller gets 4¬¢ more, the buyer gets 3¬¢ off, and the trade costs the little guy just 1¬¢ instead of 8¬¢. \"Traders' compensation depends on marking up trades and keeping wide spreads,\" he says. \"You'd have to be Mother Teresa not to fall for that temptation.\"\n\n[How Robinhood (and the other brokerages that have followed them) Make Money on Trades Despite Taking No Commissions](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/13/how-robinhood-makes-money-on-customer-trades-despite-making-it-free.html)\n\nWhat is Payment for Order Flow?

One would have expected them to load up on those sweet sweet low interest debt like every other company. But STMP management is highly conservative(that's why they are avoiding guidance, I suppose).\n\nSome of its products have mixed reviews online. But ShipStation and its recent product portfolio have good reviews.\n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\nWhile some of its products have outdated stacks, they are heavily upgrading their software stack. 1M paid subscribers reached already(churn is low). And with a 77% gross margin, it literally prints money.

In e-commerce generally, the strength of our partnership network for shipping is unmatched.\\* -from the latest earnings call.\n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\nNote: their exists alternatives to some of its solutions(even a partially free one), but they don't integrate well with all providers and doesn't have all the solutions, and as a business customer, not having all the cost savings opportunity is not having an opportunity at all.\n\nWhile when they terminated their deal with USPS the stock dropped heavily, the current COVID crisis proved that the management was right all along and this was the right choice for them.\n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\nSTMP is expanding internationally, and its international expansion is being hugely underrated IMO. Brexit may create some difficulty in the short term, but on the whole, it would be highly positive.\n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\nStock is highly volatile, especially surrounding earnings, this I see as a positive for the Reddit gamblers. But the negative is its low volume.\n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\nIt has 90% institutional ownership. STMP could also double its repurchase program up to $120M till August. Very low short interest(no short sq ueeze for you).\n\n\nAnalyst price targets range from $280 to $405.\n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\nAlthough I don't trust Glassdoor much. CEO has 90% approval. Negative reviews don't point to too much flaws other than the usual staff. But they have a low diversity score.\n\nAnd although employees say that they feel like a family, as a result of this, there seems to be some conflicts between STMP lifers and the newer employees.\n\nManagement's COVID handling is also praised.\n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\nAs a kinda SAAS company, I don't see why you can't invest in it. Especially, when there's rumour of rebranding on the cards. For reference, PLTR is expected to grow 30% for the next 4 years, isn't really profitable and stuff and look at PLTR's valuation metrics(P/S etc). While STMP will not likely grow that much(they grew around 30% CAGR for the last 5), it does have good growth potential in the 10-15% range(along with M&amp;A possibilities).\n\nAlso, it's not ATH, unlike some of the other ticker that gets frequently discussed. [CHART](https://imgur.com/a/vDvD8xV)\n\nNot to mention, Alexa web rank shows almost all the various stamps website growing hugely(Metapack declined) in traffic in the last 90 days.\n\n[For the people confused wth this company does. Here's all the details you would need.](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_13798a9768558fb36c854714f42a4ef7/stamps/db/641/4666/pdf/2021+Company+Presentation+-+Website+%28Mar-21%29+-+FINAL.pdf)\n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, to add. IMO, long term trend is that more and more sales is gonna go digital and a big portion of this could be filled by small and medium enterprises who would use Shopify, Amazon etc channels to make their sales. STMP simplifies their work and saves them money in shipping and other stuffs like no other company. I would say, this makes them in just the right place in the right time. So, I would say, it's a long hold(a buy it and forget it stock)\n\n\n*How this will play out?*\nIt will jump heavily before its earnings report in June and will dump after the earnings report(most likely scenario). This is how it played out in all the last quarters. It‚Äôs a classis case of buy the rumour, sell the news. Do remember though, past events don't really dictate future events\n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\nBearish case: Company executives seem to always dump their shares when they receive options (I know they gotta eat, but still). This is diluting and neutralising the buyback.\n\nOther alternatives could develop that could challenge its position. While they are not doing now, it is still good practice to remember that it is not impossible.\n\nThis stock is not for the faint of heart because of its volatility.\n\nAnd has very little options volume. So it‚Äôs kind of a shares play.\n\nManagement also seems to be ultra conservative, always preserving cash and stuff. While it is fine for a Japanese company. US stocks tend to get discounted if management does this sort of stuff(think BRK.B).\n\nAlso, their cash position seems to suggest they will likely conduct an M&amp;A which could negatively affect the stock in the short term.\n\n[10-K](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1082923/000108292321000033/stmp-20201231.htm)\n\nI hope this helped you discover this ticker and you could do further due diligence on it to make sure if it aligns with your investment goals.\n\nDisclaimer: This is not investment/financial advice.","created_utc":"2021-03-22 09:53:25","num_comments":3,"score":16,"upvote_ratio":0.79,"is_original_content":false,"permalink":"/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mao3ro/stampscomstmp_an_interesting_play/","title":"Stamps.com(STMP): An Interesting Play","author":"nafizzaki","firstseen":"2021-03-24 21:45:27.521801"}

There is no confirmation that she is the replacement at this time.\n\nNo known impact on volume yet from this breaking news.\n\n**3/8** - [Gamestop governance update](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-provides-corporate-governance-update) announcing a new board for the e-commerce transition led by Ryan Cohen. This was announced pre-market.\n\n3 day action around that announcement:\n\n03/09/2021 Open: $217.71  Close: $246.90  Vol: 39,099,330\n\n03/08/2021 Open: $154.89  Close: $194.50  Vol: **63,565,620**\n\n03/05/2021 Open: $128.17  Close: $137.74  Vol: 30,733,670\n\n\n\n**2/23** - [Gamestop announces resignation of CFO](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-announces-resignation-cfo-and-succession-plan-support) and succession plan.

After the CFO announcement on the 23rd, the price spiked and a new floor established around $110-130 until the next catalyst hit on the 8th. The price really took off after that, gaining $40 from open the 8th, over $50 by closing on the 10th, and continuing upward trajectory until the major flash-crash on the 10th brought momentum to a halt. We've consolidated consistently around $200 since then.

Your autistic brain is most likely confused right now, what did this retard say? Let me explain.\n\n**Burry is essentially indirectly buying Volkswagen shares at a significant discount. He's doing this by investing into Porsche SE (POAHY) instead of Volkswagen (VWAGY).**\n\n* Porsche SE is the largest stakeholder of Volkswagen, they own 31.4% of the entire company.\n* Porsche SE also holds the largest Volkswagen voting rights (ordinary shares) at 53.3% \n* Porsche SE is not the Porsche car brand (known as Porsche AG)\n* An investment into Porsche SE (POAHY), is an investment into Volkswagen at a discounted share price. The Volkswagen shares that Porsche SE owns is significantly worth more than Porsche SE‚Äôs current market-cap.\n* Volkswagen current market-cap is 153 billion, 31% of that is 48 billion. There should also be an extra premium on top of that $48 billion as they hold 53.3% of Volkswagen majority voting rights. Porsche SE current market-cap is only 31.5 billion. \n* Porsche SE also has other investments in Lidar and software companies such as Aurora Labs/AEVA.\n* This is a sort of arbitrage opportunity that the market still hasn‚Äôt fixed.\n* Simply put, Porsche SE has the largest ownership and majority voting rights of Volkswagen.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nVolkswagen recently had their own type of \"battery day\" and showed they're dedicated into investing in a EV future (More than $40 billion). They sold more than 9 million vehicles worldwide last year compared to Tesla's under 500K. Tesla lost double digit EV marketshare in Europe in 2020 and the VW ID3 is closing in on Tesla Model 3 sales. Volkswagen has the large customer base, brand power, assets, factories, and EV tech to dominate Europe in the EV industry soon. \n\nTLDR: Porsche SE (POAHY) seems to be the best way to invest into Volkswagen's EV future at a major discounted price.  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qqrdmpv1ljo61.png?width=1320&format=png&auto=webp&s=2fcd354ab0de89b26133694f554f224fe3affacd","created_utc":"2021-03-22 04:42:27","num_comments":294,"score":1236,"upvote_ratio":0.94,"is_original_content":false,"permalink":"/r/wallstreetbets/comments/maiolz/the_arbitrage_michael_burry_trade_on_volkswagen/","title":"The arbitrage Michael Burry trade on Volkswagen","author":"universeatom","firstseen":"2021-03-24 21:45:27.526519"}

But I think that is a shallow comparison, given that [RKT is more than just a pureplay mortgage company](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m8olrf/why_rkt_is_not_just_a_mortgage_company_with_an_app/). So what are some other metrics that we can use to compare these companies? One way is to also check their P/S, which is used a lot for growth companies that sometimes have losses and does not have a proper P/E. RKT has a P/S of 2.87, with a $45B market cap on $16B sales; what about these pure-play mortgage company peers?\n\nCOF - 2.26\n\nESNT - 5.24\n\nPFSI - 0.99\n\nWD - 3.14\n\nUWMC - 3.99\n\nSo you can see here that RKT is middle of the pack. Why is it that RKT has average P/S valuation but high P/E valuation? The difference here is in spending - the higher expenses of RKT is making the EPS lower. What is RKT spending on and why does the spending make RKT stand out? They are reinvesting in the business - buying marketing, spending for infrastructure (they have a 2500 software team, larger than any of these other companies), acquiring other businesses, etc. You might argue and say maybe RKT is really inefficient and has a bunch of useless employees? Lets quickly check this: RKT has 20,000 employees and $16B sales, UWMC has 7000 employees and $3.62 sales, COF has 52,000 employees and $26B sales... you get the idea, RKT is pretty efficient with their staff.\n\nSo in the end, it's clear that based on sales, RKT is not overvalued. Their high P/E ratio is because they are reinvesting in the company, just as a growth company would do. Their investment in infrastructure and automation already clearly shows up in their staff efficiency.","created_utc":"2021-03-21 22:33:20","num_comments":97,"score":280,"upvote_ratio":0.74,"is_original_content":false,"permalink":"/r/wallstreetbets/comments/macryp/rkts_growth_story_shows_up_in_its_financials/","title":"RKT's growth story shows up in its financials","author":"CMScientist","firstseen":"2021-03-24 21:45:27.528532"}

Thanks to TA, mine **barely** survived. It is messy out there, making it very difficult to trade. Honestly, if you‚Äôre down, that‚Äôs understandable because these are not normal conditions. We just had a 12 month flash course on market behavior. What we‚Äôve witnessed in this short time happens in the span of 3+ years, not months.\n\nBright side is, we learned a lot. Through pain and punishment. Turns out those lessons are the most kept. It‚Äôs like we are little puppies.\n\n**So, what do we do?**\n\nWe do what seasoned traders have been doing for decades. We understand the basics of charts and practice technical analysis. It‚Äôs gonna be a long Sunday read but I promise, it‚Äôll be an eye-opening one for most of you. Don‚Äôt worry. Basics are super simple and I won‚Äôt confuse you with pattern terminology.\n\nIf you‚Äôre not using these methods already, this post is going to improve the way you trade exponentially while minimizing losses if your trade begins going south. You'll be able to apply these methods on short and long term positions.\n\nI received a PM from a fellow Redditor yesterday, saying his puts lost half the value. I‚Äôm sure those losses would not have been this big if TA was involved. We will get it back my dude. Read on.\n\n**Resistance and support**. Two simple, magical words we‚Äôre going to cover today.\n\nYou‚Äôre gonna love the story behind this trade. Perfect example of how powerful technical analysis can be. Below is a **$7K buy-in, 0tde SPY 390 call** I traded on Friday. One hundred percent based on a known pattern.\n\nI'd like for you to pay attention to time of entrance (**at support**) and exit (**at resistance**) then match those with order execution times which you will find on top.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d2nrriswrgo61.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=78703c09cfc24458b1d63ddde0c022038dd1f72f\n\n**Back story**. Folks, I can't make this shit up if I want to. I'm two inches away from my screen, glued. Watching green candles pile up over support, printing...On the way to 390 resistance. I know if it breaks, we're going 391 easy..Last I saw was 389...Goddam power flickered, caused a reset on my modem. Panic sunk in.\n\nAbout 45 seconds later, connection came back. I remember I kept saying please be above 390...please be above 390....I knew as a fact, when it hits that major resistance at 390, there's a fat chance of rejection, sending my greens to red in matter of fifteen seconds.\n\nI saw 390.12 on screen. Smashed sell. Could've been a good trade gone wrong. My original plan was to sell half at resistance and sell the other half after a possible break out. Slightly above 391, those contracts were going for $1.50 per.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d0f493b8sgo61.jpg?width=519&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=61db8ae9c9f115ae33f5aacfbfd8f24e7cc3ddda\n\nLet‚Äôs step away from day trading, apply support and resistance basics on longer term charts. After all, you need to be mentally unstable in some way to even consider day trading.\n\nWe‚Äôre gonna take General Electric as example. Starting with it‚Äôs 6 month chart, then zoom into weekly.\n\nOn **October 10th 2018**, GE closed at what seems to be a random, insignificant price. $13.28.\n\nOn **February 12th 2020**, it hit $13.26. Failing to close above $13.30 once again. Think about it. After millions of trading volume and after 16 months, it touched the same number and traded down the following days. Crazy accuracy, couple cents.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3tumqvxssgo61.jpg?width=1532&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=06512087a5ea457dabb354960c24c5d548f495e2\n\nClearly, what seemed to be chaotic, random price action is not chaotic and random. It follows rules and order of it's own. Just like everything else around us.\n\nStay with me.\n\n**Drawing bearish and bullish channels**\n\nHere's the GE weekly chart. Each candle represents one hour.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pwxrsx91ugo61.jpg?width=1532&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d0b6361605df5fe66cfdac3d6c6cbe2c15b1a44b\n\nSuper simplified. You take the bottom of the **lowest candle** (**A**) and draw a line until it touches the bottom part of another candle that's trending up **(B).**\n\nNow, we repeat that on top portion. This time, starting a line at the top of candle **(C)** and ending at another candle that is trending up **(D).** Bullish channel is complete.\n\nUsing same principals, you can also draw a bearish channel. In that case, instead of pointing up, channel will be pointing down.\n\nNext, we‚Äôre going to add to our chart what‚Äôs proven to be the resistance at $13.2x. Purple horizontal line.\n\nGuess what price GE closed on Friday. ü§Ø\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ssi2kllbvgo61.jpg?width=1529&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6e6ac7bbb85f40bd35a4232c794b39f8f4d54cfc\n\n**So, buying short expiry puts Monday on GE is free money? It failed to break resistance again and again.**\n\nNo. Analyze the chart below. Area I highlighted shows it actually did break the resistance intraday and held all the way to closing bell. There‚Äôs a big possibility that resistance is now a potential support. What we‚Äôre seeing on the highlighted portion could be the back test of said support, closing at $13.2x and not below it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kma6obvoxgo61.jpg?width=1529&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6a7be213dc070bc178a35316600bfa84a8f77ea4\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**As a case study, what do we look for Monday eod?**\n\nWe look for confirmation. If we see a strong green candle close above $13.50, in my book that‚Äôs a long buy (calls). Likely 13.2x resistance becoming support.\n\nIf we see a strong red candle finish below 13, breaking down our bullish channel, that signals resistance held once again and it will most likely continue to go down, once again. Puts galore.\n\n**Here‚Äôs the part that matters for you the most.**\n\nDo not buy calls near major resistance. Period. Buy the confirmed support. Sell the confirmed resistance.\n\nWe see paper handing comments all the time. ‚ÄúIf I were to hold two more days, I could‚Äôve doubled my money‚Äù.\n\nWhy would you sell when you see green candles making higher highs inside a bullish channel? Sell when it‚Äôs close to resistance.\n\n**What about red candles inside the channel?** \n\nIt's okay. Take a look back at the **0tde SPY 390c** chart. If I were to see red candles getting close to support, I would‚Äôve sold and worst case scenario lose 10-15%.\n\n**Buy at support, sell at resistance. Buy at support, sell at resistance and don‚Äôt look back.**\n\nApply these principals to your weeks, months out expiry contracts. Pull charts that each candle represents 4 hours minimum, one day candles ideally. TA is much easier and accurate when it's based on longer time frames. **I'm telling ya, damn thing closed at 13.2x two years ago!**\n\n**Minimizing losses when trade goes south.**\n\nThis is the hardest part to execute. Denial, hope, what ifs... I lost $24K two weeks ago by not practicing what I'm about to preach.\n\nI added red candles on our GE Chart to simulate a support break. Each candle represents four hours. Take a look. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hzjczrif3ho61.jpg?width=1529&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8d1495016c42c920d0cf0754011f7d8a142cb5e6\n\nAt this point, it's pretty much gg. Even though we see a green candle at the end, due to time decay, calls are destroyed. Basically, it needs 3 perfect green candles just to get back inside and 3 more candles to start trending up in the channel. 4 hour candles, by the time that happens, 30-50% poofed. In this scenario, I bet bears would buy puts at first sight of support break which I wouldn't blame and definitely participate.\n\n**I'd like to point this out again. Some charts I showed you guys as examples are short time-framed. You're better off applying these basics on charts that each candle represents one day, assuming your position is not expiring in 48 hours. Remember this as beginners, longer expiration, more data, better TA. More gains, less losses.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI‚Äôm anxious to see how next week is going to play out. We‚Äôre stuck, yo-yoing between support and resistance on pretty much all indexes and big caps. It‚Äôs simply not possible for me as an apprentice trader to speculate.\n\nWhat I know is this. I‚Äôm not touching TSLA. I‚Äôm not touching AAPL or SPY or QQQ or any ticker that has been chopping up and down between support and resistance. Bunch of noise. Time decay. Not good for option contracts.\n\nI want to see resistance break and hold for calls.\n\nI want to see support fail for puts.\n\nDon't know about you but I like my money. Not going to close my eyes, open a position and hope for the best. Buying based on gut feeling, selling on gut feeling. That‚Äôs gambling not trading.\n\nI get the biggest kick when I see my people after Friday close saying, ‚ÄúShit...What am I gonna do now for 48 hours?‚Äù\n\nWell sir...You pull out crayons, draw some lines, look for opportunities. Add more layers to charts. Moving averages, bullish cross overs, RSI...It‚Äôs a treasure hunt.\n\nThis is the way. \n\nCheers.","created_utc":"2021-03-21 21:34:22","num_comments":534,"score":4979,"upvote_ratio":0.92,"is_original_content":false,"permalink":"/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mabmyk/youre_buying_based_on_gut_feeling_selling_on_gut/","title":"You‚Äôre buying based on gut feeling, selling on gut feeling.

They want badly to be the USMCA railroad and have been put down by regulators multiple times despite raising cash for huge companies like Norfolk Southern.\n\nUS regulators have been blocking it because their buyouts would have arguably reduced market options and railroads are the one piece of semi-public assets the US still seems to be on board with protecting.  This small $25 billion dollar deal resolves the problem because instead of picking up a major rail network Canadian Pacific brokered a deal with a short line  ü©≥‚ûñrailroad service.  \n\nIn this case the Kansas City Southern is a very limited route with half of it's rail in mexico and it's US rail being simple long isolated stretches rather than the web a company like Norfolk provides.  So the primary regulatory concern is gone and from an international trade standpoint this would actually be a win.\n\nOther Factors: \n\nRailroads are good recovery stocks.  Supply lines and distribution are a mess with back logs right now.  Ports are backed up, raw materials are missing and Texas getting shutdown by the storm hit a number of industries in that area hard.  Rail lines provide the ability to move large amounts of freight at lower prices than any other method on the globe.  \n\nRailways are also increasingly green technology.  They were already the most efficient transportation method on the market but the technology keeps improving and railways has lots of incentive to adapt as energy costs are one of the major factors in their profits.  This means the industry likely doesn't see any pain coming out of the Biden administration and can likely get a piece of an alleged infrastructure bill.\n\nBoomer Points:\n\nRailways give dividends!  Thats extra money in your pocket.  Great secure industry that isn't going anywhere.  Millennials may be afraid of üöÇ but they need trains to move ü•ëüçû and the less millennials talk about an industry the less likely they are to try to cancel it.   Rail is secure and GROWING.  \n\nRailways are simple and easy to understand.  People need to move things and üöÇ are üí™ alone.  \n\nThis would literally be a new transcontinental railroad just in the other direction!  It is üöÇ history in the making!\n\nWarnings : The last two merger attempts by CP failed.  This is their third shot at an end goal of getting direct access lines tied together between the USMCA counties.  Probably the most likely to succeed but no guarantee.\n\nRail is slow and that makes it vulnerable to other developments in the transit market (see self driving electric trucks).  The market is strong and showing promise but needs to push it's own technology forward to remain competitive long term.  Not to say they aren't trying but the auto industry has way more Engineers.\n\nPositions;. Currently none.  Merger was announced today.  Calls are pricey but I'm going to try to buy in early Monday.  Rail is actually beating the market anyway.","created_utc":"2021-03-21 21:24:26","num_comments":86,"score":288,"upvote_ratio":0.88,"is_original_content":false,"permalink":"/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mabg4o/dd_boomer_editioncanadian_pacific_to_merge_with/","title":"DD Boomer Edition:Canadian Pacific to Merge with Kansas City Railroad. üöÇ I am autistic so I like the trains.","author":"PatrickSebast","firstseen":"2021-03-24 21:45:27.529574"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"605bb2f75df7eedfb49c1e1a"},"id":"mabcno","fullname":"t3_mabcno","selftext":"  \n\nMarathon Oil (MRO)\n\nIn recent trends I have noticed the huge ups and downs with the Big Oil Companies. Only 2 within the energy sector stand out. The main one that I find that still has plenty of value you is MRO and it is flush with cash. Presently MRO has 742 Million cash on hand and pays a reasonable dividend. \n\nDividend Yield / Amount\n\nDividend\n\nThe dividend shown represents the issuer's standard recurring dividend and does not reflect any special dividends.\n\n1.12% / $0.03\n\nEx-Dividend Date\n\n02/16/2021\n\nDividend Payable Date\n\n03/10/2021\n\nNext Earnings Date\n\n05/05/2021\n\nIf you compare this to COP or CONOCO-PHILLIPS, MRO / Marathon is cheap and actually oversold. It is true the Marathon Oil has a main office in Findlay, Ohio and that is about 45 minutes from me. So, I am all for the local people. It is also true that in 2019 that MRO was over $20.00 a share. \n\nAnd I quote as far as cash is concerned \n\n‚ÄúThe latest balance sheet data shows that Marathon Oil had liabilities of US$1.07b due within a year, and liabilities of US$6.33b falling due after that. Offsetting this, it had US$522.0m in cash and US$620.0m in receivables that were due within 12 months. So, its liabilities total US$6.25b more than the combination of its cash and short-term receivables.‚Äù (Simply Wall St 2020). \n\nThis will improve by years end as MRO and the entire sector has seen increase in the price per barrel Brent Sea Crude as high as 70.00 a barrel. It is expected that Oil will be closer to $80.00 a barrel by the end of Summer as people are tired of the hole BS Covid thing and have decided to just get out and go. Presently Brent Sea Crude is trading at about $63.00 a barrel. As I previously said this will ultimately increase profits for MRO (Marathon). But presently MRO last traded at 11.02 a share and I have seen a lot of activity for April 09th Call options with a strike price of $14.00 a share, and at that level the Implied Volatility is around 77%, meaning it can either got to $14 a share of go to $0.\n\nAlso, and I hate to say this but Neal Dingmann at Truist Financial has his price target at $15.00 a share. If I were to follow him. It would reinforce my theory that MRO is not only a Value play, but WAY OVER SOLD!!! I know you APE will down vote this as you always do. So, it is expected, but half of you apes will end up going out and buying shares after down voting it. But facts are facts and if I read everything correctly MRO(Marathon) had a 40% upside earnings surprise. Also, as I quote ‚ÄúBased on its pre-COVID enterprise value to PV-10 premium, MRO shares might have more than 30% upside given where WTI stands today.‚Äù (Seeking Alpha as of 19 March 2021). It seems the shorts/bears want this want at $10.00 a share and the short interest is only about 6% of the total shares outstanding. Just remember I look for cheap STONKS that are oversold and are flush with Tendies$$$$$. I am not telling you to buy anything, and I do not work for MRO, and this is not advice. I will add that the MAE(Moving Average Envelope) is showing an upward trend in the chart. So do your own DD, like I did, and on what little free time I have and take a look for yourself. I don‚Äôt claim to know shyte! I do know cheap, and I do like $$$GAINZ. Also, I will add this, if somehow magically MRO gets to $15.00 a share by the 1st of April, I will eat a wrecking ball pepper and show proof via video. So, I dare you all to watch my pain if that happens‚Ä¶.","created_utc":"2021-03-21 21:19:47","num_comments":44,"score":38,"upvote_ratio":0.66,"is_original_content":false,"permalink":"/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mabcno/some_dd_on_mro_its_not_perfect_and_i_might_even/","title":"some DD on MRO, its not perfect and I might even suck at it.....

Can we now all agree that not withstanding all the other theories such as RH internalizing orders, citadel writing naked options, DTCC about to audit fake shares, 3/23 earnings blowout, VR+e-sports transformation,  shorts over 100%; Gamma has been the main factor of the week to week price movement these past few weeks. I'm not saying those other theories are untrue, but they don't provide actionable intelligence for ü¶çü¶çü¶ç to trade besides HODL, which at 0.7% shorts borrow rate might take a looong time. Furthermore, when institutions/whales do a short squeeze, they usually follow it up with recalling their loaned up shares, like what /u/MartinShkreli did with $KBIO, though he was able to do this effectively because he had control of >50% float thus able to coordinate the timing.\n\nSome important points\n\n1. Gamma/Delta goes both ways, it can amplify upward momentum but can also accelerate a downward spiral.\n2. Delta Hedging is a continuous process. The moment you bought an option, within minutes MM bots will start delta hedging your options.   They don't suddenly start to buy the hedge only when nearing ITM or Friday's close.\n3. Buying options at specific strikes and expiries can give you 4-10X amount of share buying amplification compared to buying shares directly due to MMs delta hedging by buying the underlying shares. You may not need to buy options to trigger a gamma squeeze, provided the OI already supports it, a small price increment might be enough to tip it over.\n4. Yes the IV is damn high at +300%, highest in the market in fact,  making ATM and near OTM very expensive, but  that doesn't mean it can't go higher. Ideally for a gamma squeeze we should start with low IV and ladder it up, however you play with the cards your dealt with. Ms Alexis Goldstein / u/dontfightthevol testified in congress that option probably contributed to most of the volatility [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m7h6uv/what\\_was\\_the\\_footprint\\_of\\_institutional\\_trading/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m7h6uv/what_was_the_footprint_of_institutional_trading/)\n5. Short Hedgies are using PUTS to short $GME, PUT/CALL ratio increase almost 10x on long dated expiries. Hedgies love to short because in trading as in life, failures occur much more frequently then successes. Thus it is way easier for hedgies to instigate a business collapse by publishing negative press, influencing creditors, and launching frivolous lawsuits against a business rather than trying to create success.\n6. Make no mistake, this is a battle. It doesn't matter at this point if on earnings 3/23 GME announce new VR tech with e-sports or all 5,509 GameStop stores were to somehow spontaneously combust. All that matters is the buying vs selling amount and the max pain each side is willing to tolerate\n\nI believe if ü¶çü¶çü¶ç understand the mechanics of a play, they would be more willing to commit their hard earned   üçå to it, ü¶çü¶çü¶ç together  üí™ , ü¶çü¶çü¶ç + üß† = mega  üçåüçå üçå\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# $GME Gamma Squeeze Calculator v8\n\nThis update contains a graph generator to visualize the total delta hedging vs underlying price and/or time decay, ***it includes 3,143 $GME options chain OI(Open Interest) up to 1/20/23 based on 3/19 closing data***. It aims to make a free retarded excel version of a Total Delta/Gamma Visualizer, frequently used by institutional traders\n\nThe calculator calculates the net buy/sell needed to be performed by MMs given certain price movement and time assumptions. There are 5 sheets with the input parameters color coded in peach orange. Parameters include\n\n* Current Price\n* Projected Price\n* Time to Projected Price (The time in days you forecast the projected price will occur)\n* Net MM%(to estimate how many % of the sold calls are written by MMs excluding covered calls/puts and theta gang spreads)\n* Strike and Expiry filter to include/exclude option chains based on strike price and date\n\nThe new graph simulator graph has the following controls\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s8fpj8ao8ho61.jpg?width=893&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bfd4cb30cb991751927cff5bfcadb601d2f6586e\n\nThat allows you to visualize the total hedge graph vs price in constant time, so you can have an overall view what the total MM delta hedging is on different price levels based on current options OI. Clicking the simulate price button would generate the graph below.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g7k5b0np8ho61.jpg?width=984&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c33983b49fe86702be4f41f95708aa23978e138a\n\nFrom the above we can glean information on how price effects total delta hedging, The call options generate positive delta hedge, while üåàüêª buying puts adds negative delta hedge. The total delta hedge converge with the puts delta hedge as price goes lower and vice versa converge with the calls delta hedge as price goes higher. It can be observed that If the price drops below $85, MMs will be net short, and further moves downward will be greatly amplified by the puts delta hedging. Thus the $85 is a level that theoretically should be defended by longs.\n\nBy clicking the simulate time button, the simulator can also show the total hedge vs time decay in days in constant price\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zj8gtxdr8ho61.jpg?width=910&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9d278ba91a635a44a91cd209cb7d93b03bdc2571\n\nFrom the graph, due to the current structure of $GME options OI, at its natural theta(time component of option greeks) decaying state, there will be a net SELL of stocks by MMs if price remains the same, leading to a downward pressure on the price. This decay is particular to High IV stocks with an option chain OI concentration of strikes above the current share price like $GME. There'll also be a significant drop as it passes the monthly expiry in 4/16, where a lot of options expire.\n\nTo find witch strikes and expiries are responsible for the largest delta hedged shares, go to the OI sheet and click sort by hedge\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4bwwm5os8ho61.jpg?width=1317&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2c43f3a8aa8568ebace2de5f1fdf4e9cd114072a\n\nTo find the biggest shorts delta, sort by hedge from smallest\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yb8j1jdu8ho61.jpg?width=1315&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a6495f3c8ea70a1a543a62a3d03bcda5cd75b3d8\n\nYou can use the index2 field to return the original sort order(strikes & expiries).\n\nTo model what would happen if specific strikes and expiries increases in OI(Open Interest), go to the OI sheet and sort by amp factor.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0dyp87px8ho61.jpg?width=1188&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fc5d8d545b179f9c790de3746f74bc3dd3b0a448\n\nchange the 445C 3/26 New OI from 67 to 10,067\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5rxsyndz8ho61.jpg?width=1188&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6819b829b398d0244959845fa7914c9aa9fcfde4\n\nYou'll see the from the diff column, that 10,000 x 3.38 x(100 per contract) = 3.38 MM USD buy would trigger 106,620 net share buying by delta h\\\\edging MMs or about 21.3MM USD, giving amplification factor of 5.4X. If price were to rise, this amp factor would climb further due to positive gamma. Changes in the OI sheet will be reflected back in the Total Delta Hedge on the Cover Sheet and the Graphs. For the Graphs you'll need to run the simulation again to get updated results.\n\nOn the topic of IV too high, as $GME currently has the highest IV in the market and about MMs ripping you off; Well it's actually a bit more nuanced then that. Here's a graph for Gamma Delta vs IV , assuming $200 underlying and 7 DTE. You can find it in the Delta/Gamma sheet of the excel macro. Use that sheet template to model Delta vs Gamma for different strikes and expiries.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r74sn5ud9ho61.jpg?width=1160&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bae17addc9f5cf1d9c1dac73343fbb2847524f00\n\nGamma is not linear, depends on the underlying price and IV\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Obligatory harebrained scheme\n\nIf all ü¶çü¶çü¶ç understand delta hedging/gamma, then a play like the following would be doable.\n\n*Disclaimer : I'm not actually telling ü¶çü¶çü¶ç to do this, it's more of a what if scenario of what would happen if ü¶ç did, as many users have pointed out that according to the media this may amount to market manipulation, and market manipulation is illegal if done by retail plebs, mkay... Only hedgies are allowed to do stuff like this and naked short a company to oblivion.*\n\nFor this gamma play to work, the large short interest still needs to be true, then If you all can  üíéü§≤ , I suggest ü¶çü¶çü¶ç wait until IV drops down a bit to <200%. So that the ATM and near OTM options will be a lot more affordable. When IV drops to below 200%, ü¶çü¶çü¶ç can start building the ATM to NEAR OTM ladder, optimizing our strikes/expiries using the calculator. Why not just randomly pick near OTM price you ask ? $GME option chain have been so volatile that there were huge discrepancies in theoretical delta vs actual delta between the strikes.\n\nSummarizing, the steps are\n\n1. üíéü§≤  your shares, because it's likely to drop next week\n2. Wait for IV <200%\n3. Use the calculator to calculate best ITM,ATM, near OTM strikes(depending on your risk tolerance) with largest delta/price ratio\n4. Someone ~~post a call to action~~  do a Tarzan yell, if up vote is over the threshold buy amount needed, everybody goes all in, if not then better wait for another opportunity, no sense in wasting üçåüçåüçås. It takes ~~teamwork~~   *ü¶çü¶çü¶ç* together or the play won't work\n5. Watch price goes up end of week\n6. Defend it by buying shares on Friday 2.45 PM, just ignore all the earlier price movement on that day and instead concentrate on the close, This is when MMs try to fix price to avoid max pain\n7. Exercise if you have capital or if not, roll those calls to higher strikes\n8. Witness short hedgies cry\n9. Rinse and repeat for the following week, until the entire financial system collapse\n10.

My current thesis is they never actually mass produce a car.\n\nFirstly, their projections are to start production in Q4 2022.  Think about that for a minute.  It'll be late Q1 2023 before they plan to ship a car.  And that's IF everything goes to plan.  By then, GM, VW, Tesla, Ford, Volvo, Honda, Toyota, Lucid, and others will have a two year head start on actually delivering EVs.  By then there's no reason for someone to wait 24 months for a car.  People did it for Tesla's because they were the only game in town, but they won't do it for a Fisker.\n\nSecond, the CEO is a huge liability.  He already made decisions that ran the exact same type of company into the ground.  This does not bode well for long term success.  Yes, it could be a one off due to failed battery packs, but who approved their use?   Oh, and they just announced a partnership with Foxconn to build their next car after the Ocean.  And where?  At the (in)famous Wisconsin factory.  You remember the one?  [https://www.theverge.com/21507966/foxconn-empty-factories-wisconsin-jobs-loophole-trump](https://www.theverge.com/21507966/foxconn-empty-factories-wisconsin-jobs-loophole-trump)  .  This does not show me that he's improved his decision making.\n\nThird, price.  If they can deliver on what they are promising I will be amazed.  A 300 mile range EV with a solar roof, and full vegan interior for $37,000.  I may be wrong, but I just don't see it.  They have no proprietary tech, so will be getting all the internals from other manufacturers, but can somehow undercut their prices?  That's a leap of faith.  Faith that hasn't been earned.\n\nFourth, volume.  They will need to stand up an entire after sales support network (repair shops, trained repair techs, replacement parts, distribution, etc.) for a brand new car line.  In every country they plan to sell to.  You need huge volume to justify this.  Even Tesla is having problems getting people timely repairs to their cars.  How long will that solar roof last after the first hail storm?  Or the first drive behind a dump truck with unsecured gravel in the back?  Who's going to repair it?  How much will it cost?  How long will it take to get the parts?\n\nFifth, design.  A small concern, I know but I am thinking that by the time they ship a car their design will be outdated.  I think the car looks great now, but so does everyone else's.  And design tastes will change in the next two years.  Can they afford a design refresh before they even ship a car?\n\nFinally, they have no real differentiator.  There's no reason to buy a Fisker over any other EV that will be out ahead of them.\n\nI see canceled pre-orders, manufacturing troubles, regulatory hurdles, and ultimately a failed endeavor without anything to show for it.  Man, I hope I'm wrong, but the more I thought about it the more it didn't make sense.\n\nPositions: 4/1/21 $18p\n\nedit: typo","created_utc":"2021-03-21 20:21:43","num_comments":127,"score":158,"upvote_ratio":0.79,"is_original_content":false,"permalink":"/r/wallstreetbets/comments/maa6g3/fsr_is_worth_0_a_share/","title":"$FSR is worth $0 a share","author":"fib_seq","firstseen":"2021-03-24 21:45:27.531391"}

This was at the time that all that bullshit about a 'silver squeeze' was going round, so I thought it was interesting. One stood out in particular: $AG, because I had seen it mentioned in a lot of the shill posts about buying silver. Knowing that the whole 'silver squeeze' thing was total bullshit manufactured by someone with money and a motive i.e. probably Melvin Capital, the ones who had an incentive to divert WSB attention (and money) away from GME, I started to look at the day's other biggest movers. Strap your tinfoil hats on boys and girls.\n\nLike I say, what I did was go through that day's (28th Jan) biggest movers, and then I looked in the 13F filing available for Melvin Capital to see if MC had positions in any of them. At the time that I was looking at this, I was using the 2020 Q3 13F holdings, but since then the Q4 13F's have been made available. I'll get on to that in a minute though. First though, I want to show you the chart for GME/SPY. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4dyzatf3bgo61.png?width=1452&format=png&auto=webp&s=27fd1c05149cb9247ee2a442114e5bdd0bc5ef2b\n\nAs you can see, during the Jan/Feb squeeze (Gamma/short, whatever your opinion is on that) GME practically inverses SPY. Correlation doesn't demonstrate causation however: the point I'm making is that this is the trend that SPY was following at the time, so any correlation between GME and another stock can't really be put down to just general market trends. \n\nNow, these are the stocks I identified as having a significant price movement at the end of January which MC had put positions in as of the end of Q3.\n\n**$BBBY**\n\n[GME in orange, BBBY in Green. ](https://preview.redd.it/g11nca6cago61.png?width=1452&format=png&auto=webp&s=d23715bfefb01a62cc75f05da1ee870985b41f8b)\n\nMC position as of Q3 13F:\n\nPUT.

There is a correlation between GME and a number of other tickers that Melvin Capital held PUT positions in (according to their **Q3** 13F filings) for the period from around the 27th Jan to early Febuary 2021. \n2. According to Melvin Capital's  Q4 13F filings however, MC closed these put positions before the end of Q4. They closed their PUT positions *before* the run-up that occured in late-January 2021 across these stocks. \n3. MC opened a put position in $AG in Q4, a ticker that had a sudden, massive increase in the number of mentions on WSB around the same time GME reached it's peak. The consensus at the time was that the 'silver squeeze' was a ploy to divert the attention of WSB onto something else away from GME. \n\nThere are probably other tickers that could fit here that I've missed too. \n\n**So what the fuck are we supposed to make of this?**\n\nCould MC have known that something was about to happen with these tickers? Why is there a correlation between a video game retailer and a soda producer? A consumer robot manufacturer (IRBT) and fucking bed-bath-and-beyond? Did MC run-up these tickers in order to reposition their short positions from new highs? \n\nOnce the Q1 2020 13F's are released it will likely shed some light on what has gone on here but until then, unfortunately, it's up to the collective 14 brain cells of the WSB community to try and figure out if there's something going on here and whether that can give us information relating to GME (and possibly other tickers) going forward. After all, if you put enough monkeys in front of typewriters eventually they'll write some Shakespeare.","created_utc":"2021-03-21 19:38:02","num_comments":168,"score":1093,"upvote_ratio":0.94,"is_original_content":false,"permalink":"/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ma9aqn/correlation_between_gme_and_other_melvin_capital/","title":"Correlation between GME and other Melvin Capital Holdings","author":"captin1110","firstseen":"2021-03-24 21:45:27.532343"}

They believe it will reach $3000 per share in the next 5 years, which based on its current market price of $654 implies about a 50% annual rate of return. If you haven‚Äôt already, you can take a look at the [article](https://ark-invest.com/articles/analyst-research/tesla-price-target-2/) they published explaining how they arrived at this price target and the assumptions they made.\n\nI recently got [downvoted](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m8pntp/weekend_discussion_thread_for_the_weekend_of/grq28wo/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3) for suggesting that this price target wasn‚Äôt illogical and that Cathie wasn‚Äôt crazy. So I wanted to explain my reasoning a bit more so that more people can downvote me and tell me why I‚Äôm wrong.\n\nNow just to be clear, I‚Äôm not here to argue about whether EVs are the future, whether existing car companies are unprepared to switch to EV, or whether Tesla is an insurance play. I‚Äôm assuming that you‚Äôre already interested in investing in Tesla and the only thing stopping you is its valuation.\n\n**P/E. It‚Äôs over 1000! But is it a useful metric?**\n\nP/E seems to be the most common argument for why Tesla is overvalued. Why buy Tesla at 1023 P/E when you could buy GM at 14 P/E or even Workhorse at 23 P/E?\n\nLet‚Äôs step back a bit. Companies can be categorized into one of three stages: growth, maturity, and decline. P/E is useful for valuing mature companies against their mature competitors, since all other things being equal we‚Äôd expect their P/Es to eventually equalize as well. For example, I recently bought Target partly because of its P/E of 22 vs Walmart‚Äôs 28 and Costco‚Äôs 34 (although one could argue that some/all of these companies are still in their growth stage).\n\nOn the other hand, P/E is less useful when looking at companies in the growth and decline phases. You could find companies with P/E below 1, but they may be value traps rather than automatic buys. If they go out of business next year, their stock will be worthless.\n\nP/E is similarly flawed when looking at growth stocks. P/E doesn‚Äôt account for whether a company is spending a lot aggressively re-investing in itself, or if a company has small earnings now but a good chance of quickly growing into a much larger market. If you had the chance to buy a loss-making company now at $1B market cap now, knowing that its addressable market will quickly expand to $100B, you‚Äôd still make a profit over the long term, even buying at massively ‚Äúinflated‚Äù P/E.\n\nThat said, P/E is still useful for measuring risk in a growth stock or upside in a declining stock. If Tesla were to transition from growth to maturity or decline, there‚Äôs no doubt its P/E and share price would decline significantly. But risk is part of growth investing; this risk exists with other growth stocks too.\n\n**Forward P/E**\n\nWhile Tesla‚Äôs trailing P/E is 1023, its forward P/E is a high but less eye-popping 119. Trailing P/E is calculated by dividing the stock‚Äôs market value by its share price, while forward P/E is calculated by dividing the company‚Äôs estimated earnings in the following year by its share price. Forward P/E is a more error-prone and risky metric since nobody knows what a company will earn in the future. But it can still be useful when considering the price of a stock, since the market tends to price in expected future performance.\n\nComparing to some other popular growth stocks, Tesla‚Äôs forward P/E is still high but not unreasonable. PINS has 58, SHOP has 227, NFLX has 40. And at least it‚Äôs positive. Many growth stocks such as NIO, NKLA, lucid, PLTR, and LMND don‚Äôt expect to be profitable within the next year.\n\nAnd while Tesla‚Äôs P/E is high it‚Äôs difficult to make a direct comparison with these mentioned companies since they‚Äôre not profitable companies in the EV space. There really isn‚Äôt another profitable EV company to compare forward P/E with, and that uniqueness/first mover advantage could be partly why Tesla trades at a high forward P/E.\n\nThat said, Tesla is still overpriced if (unfairly) comparing against mature auto-makers; GM is at 10 forward P/E, F is at 8. But if you believe those companies have a chance to become EV growth companies and won‚Äôt be weighed down by their mature/declining combustion businesses, I‚Äôd argue that‚Äôs more of a reason to buy them than to sell Tesla.\n\n**Price-to-sales**\n\nIf a company is re-investing in itself aggressively, it may be incurring costs that aren‚Äôt part of its core business. Once growth slows, it may be able to cut these expenses and dramatically improve its P/E. To account for this, we can look at price to sales.\n\nTSLA‚Äôs price-to-sales is 20. For comparison, SHOP is at 47, PLTR is at 40, FVRR is at 42, NIO is at 27, NKLA is chilling at 63619, lucid is at infinity since it doesn‚Äôt have sales yet. It‚Äôs quite an oversimplification to make these comparisons without considering what portion of a company‚Äôs expenses is related to operating costs. SHOP has better margins than TSLA for example, since it‚Äôs in a totally different business. But nevertheless, one could argue TSLA is currently undervalued by this metric, even compared to other EV companies.\n\n**A historical example**\n\nAnother common argument is that the whole market is overvalued right now, and this is especially the case for growth stocks. I don‚Äôt pretend to know what the market will do in the short term, and I‚Äôm certainly not discounting the possibility of a further rotation out of growth in the near future. But I know that eventually the market will rotate back into growth stocks. You may have looked like a fool buying Amazon or Microsoft at the height of the dot com bubble, but if you held until now, you‚Äôd get the last laugh.\n\nSo let‚Äôs look at an example from a time when there was less talk about stocks being overvalued. Facebook IPO‚Äôd in 2012 at a P/E of 91.2 and price to sales of 24 ([source](https://www.forbes.com/sites/johndobosz/2012/05/17/facebook-is-flat-out-expensive-compared-to-google-at-ipo/?sh=5c83b70c6d03)). Both FB at the time and TSLA now have an annual growth rate of about 45%.\n\nIf we take Tesla‚Äôs forward P/E, this comparison actually makes Tesla‚Äôs price look reasonable, even though Tesla currently trades in a market with record high average P/E.\n\n**Market cap**\n\nOne last note - market cap. Yes, Tesla‚Äôs market cap is quite high as it‚Äôs already one of the most valuable companies in the world. At $654B, if Tesla actually reached $3000 per share it would be the most valuable company in the world (unless other top companies continue to grow as well, which is likely).\nThe global market for EVs is expected to grow to $800B by 2027, from $162B in 2019. If this is accurate, and you believe Tesla retains its market share and current valuation, without expanding into other areas like ride hailing and insurance, then  the EV market ~5Xing could justify Tesla‚Äôs share price ~4.5Xing.\n\n**Tl;dr**\n\nWhile Tesla is certainly overvalued by trailing P/E, this is a somewhat flawed metric, and by looking at other metrics like forward P/E, price-to-sales, and growth rate, an argument can be made that Tesla is more-or-less fairly valued, and potentially even undervalued. This argument holds even if looking at historical examples from less frothy markets, such as FB after its IPO in 2012.\n\nLike any growth stock, Tesla is a high-risk investment, since its future share price depends on future growth of both the company and the EV space. But the potential for reward is also higher.\n\nI‚Äôm not a financial advisor and this isn‚Äôt financial advice.\nPositions: $4k in Tesla shares, $15K in ARK LEAPs","created_utc":"2021-03-21 16:05:21","num_comments":363,"score":329,"upvote_ratio":0.76,"is_original_content":false,"permalink":"/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ma4uwb/tsla_fundamentals_analysis_why_its_not_overvalued/","title":"TSLA fundamentals analysis - why it's not overvalued","author":"KennanCR","firstseen":"2021-03-24 21:45:27.535385"}

Please ~~bear~~ bull with me, because this will be long. Some of you have probably seen my other posts and this will be much the same; however, this technical analysis will be more in-depth and will cover a wider ranger of indicators than previous posts. I am a technical trader and these are the indicators that I have used in the past and that I have found helpful, but this is in no way exhaustive and there are many other indicators and trading styles that are just as useful as these. Finally, I am not a financial advisor, this is not financial advice, my brain is literally a senile amoeba. As you can probably tell, I have an ADHD medicine prescription. I worked very hard on this and hope that you apes enjoy it!\n\n**Volume - catalysts**\n\nI put volume here first becuase it is BY FAR the most important indicator for a stock and ESEPCIALLY GME. Let me be clear, volume is king. Volume is god. Volume is your wife's boyfriend's wife's boyfriend's wife's boyfriend's wife's pimp's boyfriend's boss' 3rd wife's byofriend (that might be an understatement tbh). If you look at GME's chart, every single giant price increase was preceded by a large influx of volume. This is not unique to GME, as any stock requires a massive amount of volume for a massive increase in price:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x4y89amnrfo61.png?width=1071&format=png&auto=webp&s=f162175a836a710ce3896fa61f45706ded9fdc2e\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUnderstand that volume is the only thing that will make this stock spike, as with any stock. The stock is not going to magically go to the moon without a ton of people on the buy side. Again, this is not exclusive to GME. When a stock has a great earnings report, acquisition news, FDA approval, etc, you will see a massive volume spike that leads to a massive increase (or decrease) in price. Now you're probably thinking to yourself, \"ok Uncle Hank, but my tiny ape brain can't comprehend what makes volume increase.\" Well, volume is simply the number of people buying or selling the stock, so that begs the question, what makes more people buy or sell a stock? Catalysts. We have seen that GME is especially sensitive to catalysts. I believe that this is because WSB/retail investors own a LARGE portion of GME's float, so that guarantees that there are a stable number of holds, so when there is news, demand spikes while supply is still low. I am now going to go over the past catalysts that made GME spike so you can get an idea of this. First, here is a pic of GME's volume since January. I call it an angsty teenage boy's hair because it is SPIKEY:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mhtvivaprfo61.png?width=675&format=png&auto=webp&s=e31b6d1d9b3521a4c18be7636526e13d8c334dd7\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe very first spike in GME's volume was in November when our lord and daddy Ryan Cohen announced his stake in GME. This isn't pictured here because it isn't significant compared to volume from the past few months. I think at that point most people thought cohen was on DMT when he hit the buy button for GME. The first big spike on here is in early January (11-13th ish), which is when Ryan Cohen was announced as being a member of the board. This is when people were like \"ok maybe Cohen wasn't on DMT, but he def took some wicked shrooms when he pushed that buy button\"). In the next few days we see volume decline but still elevate compared to previous levels because of increased media attention. The next jump, which was very red was when our special needs friend Andrew Left announced his short position, which subsequently led to WSB ass ramming him on the internet (dude literally got his cheeks clapped by a bunch of apes and had a tantrum). This is where things really started to kick off. After this, there is a giant orgy of volume for a few days because of Elon tweets, Chamath support, Mark Cuban talking to us, media coverage, and the revelation that GME was shorted over 100%. This was the frenzy of late January. After that, everything died down regarding volume, price, and media attention. HOWEVER, the volume picked back up (and price corresponded) when GME ousted their CFO. Most people thought that Cohen had something to do with this. Full disclosure, I thought that GME was done when it tanked the first time, and this showed me its true power. We then see one more volume spike when it was announced that Cohen was being appointed as the head of the board that would change GME to a digital company. Since then, volume has gone down. The following charts show GME's volume and price in each of the past few months so you can get an idea of how crucial volume is:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pc3a5kxqrfo61.png?width=182&format=png&auto=webp&s=e21bb57d541c82bd0973f991f608243999a05189\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5p55jvxqrfo61.png?width=182&format=png&auto=webp&s=17d87c7618a76a429820adce815d235cbecc0601\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dzq9bkxqrfo61.png?width=171&format=png&auto=webp&s=a3b11369d73f5a62f36b5cbaf5ee82194a4b7457\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, now you understand that volume is king and is the only thing that will move GME. When people talk about (X will move GME), they are saying that the event will create positive volume, which will allow GME to rise. So, what are the potential catalysts we have in the future for this volume rise? Earnings is obviously the closest one. The actual numbers don't really matter here. If GME beats significantly, it might cause a rise, but the real thing that we're looking for is the conference call. On the conference call, if we hear news about the digital transformation, acquisitions, a new CFO, or anything relating to Cohen, there will be massive volume and a price increase. If those things are not discussed on the earnings call, then they will be catalysts in the next few months. If GME appoints a new CFO, I believe that catalysts will significantly drive it up as we saw the price 4x in a few days when they merely announced that they ousted the old one. If Cohen gets appointed CEO... oh.... get fucking ready. So, now you understand that Volume is king and all this talk of \"the squeeze might happen here\" or \"the chart makes it look like the squeeze is coming\" are irrelevant if they don't coincide with an event that will significantly drive up volume.\n\n**OBV**\n\n\"But Uncle Hank, what can you tell us about volume when there haven't been giant spikes.\" Glad you asked, that's where OBV comes into play. OBV (on balance volume). is a volume indicator that was founded on the idea that volume precedes price (keep that idea in the back of your head). For those of you who didn't finish 3rd grade, precedes means it comes before. OBV is a running total of positive or negative volume that depends on price for that calculation. In this calculation, the volume of a candle is either added or subtracted to the OBV total, which is denoted by a line, depending on if it's negative or positive (this is an oversimplification but just know that it's a running total). If a candle is neutral, the volume of that candle will not be added. Thankfully, GME rarely has neutral candles cuz it's so volatile. If it's positive, the volume is added to the total, if it's negative, the volume is subtracted from the total. For example (these are random numbers, don't start eating your crayons yet), let's say a given stock's OBV is 1,000. Then, there is a negative candle with a volume of 2. The OBV would now be 998. Then, there is a positive candle with a volume of 100. The OBV would now be 1098. This is why OBV is shown as a line rather than candles like volume. OBV is a trend indicator (remember volume proceeds price), so the actual value of OBV is largely insignificant, rather the trend of OBV is what matters. Because volume proceeds price, OBV allows you to predict where a stock will go because if OBV is increasing, it means that there is a lot of volume in green candles and less volume in red candles. IMO, OBV is best used to predict where a stock is going when it's consolidating, and oh would you look at that, GME is consolidating. If a stock is consolidating and OBV is increasing, that is an indication that when it breaks the trend, it will be high. The opposite would be true if OBV was decreasing. Generally, if a stock is increasing in price and OBV is increasing, you can expect it to continue that trend. If the price is increasing but OBV is decreasing, you can expect it to go negative in the future. This all goes back to the idea that volume precedes price. The below pic shows GME's OBV (the yellow line) on different time scales.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rmbx8r3trfo61.png?width=713&format=png&auto=webp&s=b34b39b2ffdc2872f94b062827d8ae30dff7c6ba\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo what does this mean? Gonna just take this from my other post because I think I explained it well: The commonality between all of these graphs is that OBV continues to increase. If you look at the 1-year and 90-day charts, you can see that OBV took a very small hit when GME collapsed after the January squeeze. However, OBV has continually increased in value since then and is currently higher than it was in January. This means that the green candles (the uptrends) have higher volume than the red candles (the downtrends). This is extremely bullish. We can also see that although volume may be decreasing in the 30-day and 10-day charts, OBV is still increasing, which means that there is much more volume on the buy-side than the sell-side. Even with all of these monster short attacks (like the one we saw last week), there is still a net positive uptrend in OBV, which further adds to the bullish sentiment. Personally, I think that this is partially because of continued retail interest, but, more importantly, I think that this adds credence to the theory that we have an institutional ally or allies that continually buy GME and are trying to initiate the squeeze. This takes away credence from the idea that HFs are just manipulating the price up and down for their own benefit. Furthermore, many people also believe that GME and AMC are correlated. Though this may be true to an extent (they move similarly but not identically), OBV is much more bullish for GME. AMC's OBV is increasing similar to GME's but is not higher than it was in January like GME currently is. AMC's OBV dropped significantly after January and has not returned to those January levels yet. As stated above, GME is and has been above its January OBV levels for a while now. This is not to bash AMC, I am very bullish and AMC and have a position in it. All that this is showing is that GME seems to have greater bullish momentum than AMC and that the stocks are not perfectly correlated like many people think. The massive OBV of GME also suggests that it will be relatively easy for it to have a rapid, parabolic upward move.\n\nSo, now you understand that volume is king, we need volume for GME to increase, volume is not increasing, but OBV is still increasing. This is good.\n\n**SPY and VIX**\n\nMany of you have probably seen the news that GME has a disgustingly negative beta (I've seen -2, -8, and even -13). Beta essentially is the factor of how the stock follow the market. A beta of 1 would mean that the stock follows the market (if the market is up, it is up proportionately). A negative beta, however, means the opposite. It means that the stock essentially doesn't follow the market and actually goes in the opposite direction. If you've seen some of the other DDs, you can find comments from people with economics and finance degrees/knowledge saying how rare a beta THAT negative is. There are tons of other DDs with info from Bloomberg terminals and other stuff that demonstrate this negative beta. Just know that it means GME doesn't like to follow the market. Below are charts that compare GME to SPY and the VIX. SPY and VIX are the purple lines (first one is VIX, second is SPY):\n\nThough the correlation is not perfect, you can see that GME seems to be inversely related to SPY and positively related to the VIX. This makes sense because VIX spikes usually happen during market turbulence, high volume, and volatility, which are exactly what GME needs. Lucky for us, SPY is pretty fucking overbought right now. The effects of stimmys have already been priced in on SPY, and I believe that funds are going to continue to short the 10-year bond, which will push the stock market down. Essentially, the market is overbought, needs to pull back, is overinflated, and will soon have to factor in the looming threat of inflation. Again, volume is more important than this, but this is just something good to keep in line.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q1b0m8furfo61.png?width=912&format=png&auto=webp&s=8bb5544f3c48e477658f877c408af003a2dda633\n\n**Support and resistance**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/slo3fv3wrfo61.png?width=1722&format=png&auto=webp&s=7e3f924e3df995fb61353f38129c591ccf86a835\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn this section, I'm going to just give a brief overview of the support and resistance lines that we have developed. Again, sorry for all of the lines, I am a technical trader who was raised in a crayon factory, so I cannot help myself. The first thing to take a look at is the fat orange line. This line was resistance for GME when it had its second pop at the end of February. We have however since broken that resistance. As many of you know, previous resistance usually acts as future support in uptrends and this is VIOLENTLY true for GME. That fat orange line has withstood several short attacks and has literally bounced right back up since. Is this because of psychological levels? Is it a whale doing that on purpose? Is it the hedgies playing games? It's impossible to know, just know that the support is stronger than my wife's boyfriend's hatred of me. The fat yellow line on the bottom is essentially our doomsday level of support... let's not talk about that and hope we never get there. The fat green, yellow, and red lines on the top are our god levels of resistance. We had a bulltrap on the top green line just before that massive short attack. Getting above these levels is extremely crucial as they will be strong support. If we can get above the red line and stay there... MOON. Just know that we currently have some very strong support at 180ish and that is a great thing to have, especially because of how tested it has been.\n\n**Current patterns**\n\nLooking at the chart, I can see many patterns forming and almost all of them are bullish. First, you've probably seen the billions of posts of cups and handles. I can 100% see that pattern forming, and believe in its merit. Since there are so many posts on it, I won't waste your time with a picture. The first pattern that I see is a giant triangle pattern from the 513 high with support slightly below 100. This is signified by the fat yellow line on the bottom and the skinny diagonal yellow line:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u3crqynxrfo61.png?width=946&format=png&auto=webp&s=6a1df9c8da258c7a6b8c4ee448dd71fa8c71a6da\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs you can see, we broke that pattern in a bullish way and used the resistance from that (180ish) as our current iron-clad support. From there, I saw a bullish pennant pattern (the two orange lines), however, as many of you know, this pattern didn't play out as we kept testing that 180 support. Instead of forming a pennant, I believe that we have formed another bullish triangle pattern:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o3eub5fzrfo61.png?width=1722&format=png&auto=webp&s=103c416b860eb08f28d61d28ad95e05510d26b26\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat current triangle is using our 180 support level and it seems that it is trying to break the pattern in a bullish way. Now, why are these patterns bullish? When a stock makes a move upward or downward, then consolidates, it typically continues that pattern. Here is an explanation of that:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yjjz7nk0sfo61.png?width=1824&format=png&auto=webp&s=9b7dbdf8552c45fe147371cafdfb4002e5f63c42\n\nAs you can see, the graph on the left applies to us as we are currently consolidating from an uptrend. This is consistent with Elliot Wave Theory, which I am a huge supporter of. Just wanted to give a shout-out to everyone who posted EWT DD because I thoroughly enjoyed it. If you don't know what EWT is, it's basically the idea that stocks move in a repeating fractal pattern that is categorized by periods of trending movements, consolidating movements, and corrective movements. GME is currently in a consolidating movement proceeding a trending movement, which is bullish. I don't want to explain EWT because it's very complicated, so I encourage you to look at other posts about it and just know that Uncle Hank supports it. With all of this in mind, it appears that GME keeps forming triangle patterns and keeps breaking them. It is moving in a stair-step pattern where it shoots up, consolidates, then uses the previous resistance as support. This is extremely bullish:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z0fiv5g1sfo61.png?width=1662&format=png&auto=webp&s=e90c277e9796d2d5485c1633a522c18d7d85cdae\n\n**TTM Squeeze, MACD, Ichimoku:**\n\nSome of my other favorite indicators are TTM Squeeze, MACD, and Ichimoku. These indicators are purely based off of price and are trend/momentum indicators. TTM squeeze has to deal with the relationship between Bollinger bands and Keltner channels. It moves similarly to MACD, which also predicts momentum. Ichimoku makes clouds based off of previous price action and helps to indicate trends. All of those explanations were EXTREMELY general, so do some research on your own to better understand them. Importantly, all of these indicator show bullish momentum for GME. Below, I have combined the TTM Squeeze and MACD indicators (because that's how I use them). On the one week chart, the TTM and MACD indicators are extremely bullish:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wc7ah2h2sfo61.png?width=706&format=png&auto=webp&s=de6566627a85061b76dc9ea3e5e6321c60e4dd4e\n\nThe MACD is opening wider and is continuing its bullish trend (MACD is the two lines indicators. When the blue line is over the yellow one, it's bullish. The wider the distance, the more bullish). TTM also indicates the start of a very big move. When TTM is light blue, we are in the stage of the greatest momentum (you can see the light blue from late January). When we are in a dark blue phase, there is still bullish momentum but its dying). When we go into a red phase, we are in a bearish phase (you can see that throughout February). Yellow indicates that the bearish momentum is dying. From here, we can see that bearish momentum is dying and that we are ready to go into bullish territory (light blue candles). This is assisted by the fact that MACD is super bullish right now. I did this on the week chart to give a good overview of the price of GME because it's so volatile day to day that it's hard to understand it sometimes. Finally, Ichimoku. This indicator is a trailing momentum indicator. All that you need to know is that when it crosses through the red cloud, this is an indication of bullish momentum. Well, would you look at that, GME is getting ready to enter a red cloud right before earnings:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i1bonxi3sfo61.png?width=984&format=png&auto=webp&s=f0067ba6738df71b367ff56765f3fbb6de790e53\n\nThese three indicators are great on their own, but when used together they are even more powerful. MACD indicates that we are bullish RIGHT NOW. Ichimoku and TTM indicate that we are about to go into a period of extremely bullishness. THese charts all show that the bullish momentum for GME is just beginning.\n\n**A note about the \"short attacks\"**\n\nAs many of you have seen, over the past few days, GME has been through a series of sharp downturns intraday. Are these \"short attacks\" or are they one of our institutional allies purposely putting us on SSR? It's impossible to know. This will be an examination of those crashes and some potential theories.\n\nLike I said above, It's impossible to know if these short attacks were from friends or foes. What we can be sure about, however, is that it either triggered stop losses and/or pushed out paper hands. How can I be sure of this? Below are screenshots of both of the flash crashes from March. As you can see, the crash volume candle is about equal to that of the recovery candle but the price does not recover to its previous highs. What this makes me think is the short attack triggers stop losses and paper hands, then whoever did the short attack (again friend or foe) bought the shares back up. The reason why the price doesn't fully recover is because of paper hands being pushed out. I believe that the whale probably sells off all of his shares then rebuys at the lower price (hence the equivilant volume but price not fully recovering). Again, it is impossible to know if this was an actual short attack or if it was an ally trying to put it on SSR, but what you should know is that it was in no way a regular sell-off. No stock drops by over 50% two times in one month with NO NEWS CATALYSTS. If a stock drops this much, it's usually because of an investigation, missed earnings, etc. On both of these crashes, there was no news on GME at all, so do not think for a second that these instances were just regular selloffs or profit-taking - they were 100% coordinated attacks.\n\n**More on why paperhanding is stupid:**\n\nThe reason that I made this post is to highlight why paperhanding GME is not a good idea through a technical analysis. Obviously, it's not a good idea for the cause, but I'm here to show that it's night a good idea for the individual ape as well. If there's one thing to know about GME it's that it's a VOLATILE stock. This thing can and will move over 100 points (points, not percentage) in a single day. We have seen the price go from $100 to over $300 in a single day and from $350 to less than $200 in less than half an hour. It is understandable that many new traders might (for example) get in on GME at $100, watch it rise up to $350, then panic sell when it goes below $200, but I am here to give you proof that it is not beneficial to do that. Below, I have posted screen shots of several charts at various time frames since the beginning of January to now. The red circle signifies where you might have been tempted to paper hand and the green circle signifies why you would've been better off holding. It's important to note that the only way you could have lost money on GME is if you bought in above $400, but believe me, apes, we are going to go FAR above $400 in the near future. The reason that I have posted this is because, though I am feverishly against paperhanding, everyone, including myself, gets down and sometimes even paniced when GME crashes because it makes up so much of my portfolio. I suggest looking at these images everytime GME falls as a reminder that this is a long term game and that volatility is expected, but that paperhanding is not the answer... enjoy:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sz3j3q05sfo61.png?width=1218&format=png&auto=webp&s=7b5bc061312439b11974f2f1d4b5156b60f8576c\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dj25e4t7sfo61.png?width=710&format=png&auto=webp&s=5fad8bce73f52ad9666cfdc7908e203cc5393cec\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0kmyo0p8sfo61.png?width=593&format=png&auto=webp&s=3d9169f375b8a87d86c7969abfb3d10c414a6685\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s12y9ps9sfo61.png?width=610&format=png&auto=webp&s=22a8150b5e4c503201ecf6ec8de1bc0275dd55ae\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k5ky9bwasfo61.png?width=616&format=png&auto=webp&s=ec22638d1decbcc4141766ca205946c5bc9fdac0\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7v377d3csfo61.png?width=702&format=png&auto=webp&s=d92d928039cae9b5b0d29fa12b16dfe24c0c11d1\n\n**A Note about squeezes**\n\nBefore I go any further, please understand that last time was not a short squeeze. Last time was some shorts covering and a series of gamma squeezes. A short squeeze is characterized by a RAPID increase in both price and volume in a short period of time. A short squeeze is far more violent and faster than a gamma squeeze. Short squeezes can cause a series of gamma squeezes and gamma squeezes can cause a short squeeze. The reason that a short squeeze is so rapid is because TONS of people are buying, which decreases the total number of tradable shares in the float. The buying pressure creates immense price increases, which cause shorts to get margin called and have to start buying to cover (which only increases the buying pressure and price increases). This short squeeze may force market makers to delta hedge by buying more shares (gamma squeeze). Just know that the squeeze truly didn't happen last time. If it did happen, you would have seen a VIOLENT uptick in volume and price on a single day or two that was FAR higher than the 500$ highs we saw last time. It should look similar to the VW short squeeze. So, anytime you see FUD about the squeeze being over, look at the chart, see that there has not been a parabolic rise in volume and price on a single day similar to VW, finish jacking off, and thank Uncle Hank. To add more to this, if the squeeze truly did happen, then FINRA would be reporting FAR lower numbers than 50% short interest.\n\n**Why short interest might not matter**\n\nIf your eyes are glued to the WSB DD page and your hand is glued to your 2inch punisher like me, then you've probably seen the plethora of posts about how the short interest in GME isn't 50% like FINRA says. I've seen posts that say it's 65%, 120%, 200%, and even 900%. Let me tell you, those apes put in some DAMN good research to get those numbers and you should definitely listen to what they are saying. I personally believe that the SI is over what FINRA is saying because of all of the crazy/illegal stuff that hedgies are doing with ETFs and naked shorts. The point that I want to make is that it's impossible to actually know what these numbers are because of what the hedgies are doing. Again, I want to give all props to my fellow autists who make that spankin DD, and again, I agree with it, but just know that it's impossible to really know what it is. Now, I am going to make the case for why that doesn't actually matter. This is just a hypothesis, feel free to disagree with me below. I believe that GME is a stock that reacts so strongly to catalysts (see above) because of WSB and retail traders essentially owning the float. I believe that GME's flat is mostly owned by retail traders who refuse to sell. This decreases the tradable shares and essentially creates a sell wall. It also provides that there is a group of millions of shares that are simply held and not moved around and sold. Because of this, when there is good news on GME, all of the nonretail traders flood the market to buy the stock, which is mostly held by retail traders, which creates massive buy pressure. Essentially, because of WSB users diamond hands, every time there is positive news on GME, it creates a gamma squeeze. Again, this is just a hypothesis. Do I believe that the short interest is still through the roof and that the squeeze will eventually happen? Yes. However, I think that the diamond hands effect from WSB has essentially limited the supply of GME, which is why it's so sensitive to catalysts and is so volatile. In essence, diamond hands is fucking working.\n\n**FTD Squeeze**\n\nI would just like to reiterate the amazing work that one of my fellow apes did on GME. I don't remember his name but you've probably seen the manifesto about the Failure to deliver squeeze and how the FTDs are going to have to be repaid soon, which will lead to the actual squeeze. I don't have the link to it but I just wanted to acknowledge that guy and say thank you because it's really excellent DD. That DD is what people are talking about when they say that WSB users are doing better research than Wallstreet analysts. If someone could link it in a comment below, I could greatly appreciate it so other apes can see it. Also, just as another note, if you look at iBorrowDesk, GME has had less than 10k shares available to trade for the past few days. Borrow rate is still super low, but this is just an interesting thing to look at.\n\n**Closing Thots**\n\nIn short, I like the stock. If there is anything that you take away from this, remember, volume is king, the short squeeze has not happened yet, short interest might not matter, and it's only a matter of time before this thing launches to the moon. Again, this is not financial advice and I am not a financial advisor. Finally, I just wanted to thank all of you who upvote my DD and follow my account. I have always loved investing and trading, but making these DDs and hearing your reactions has become one of my favorite things to do and brings me a lot of joy. Thanks a ton apes, stay strong.","created_utc":"2021-03-21 15:57:14","num_comments":866,"score":11021,"upvote_ratio":0.98,"is_original_content":true,"permalink":"/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ma4oeo/an_illiad_of_gme_technical_analysis_and_dd/","title":"An Illiad of GME Technical Analysis and DD","author":"HomeDepotHank69","firstseen":"2021-03-24 21:45:27.535961"}

No need to be creative and interpret anything on this one - it doesn't get any clearer than this.\n\n1.) Some of you might've seen the **Credit Suisse and William Blair Analyst Ratings for PLTR** \\- Underperform with a Price Target of 20 as of February 16th 2021 (Reviewed and unchanged as of March 15th). Note that both those ratings were issued after the FY 2020 report dropped - so after seeing the 47% increase in revenues.\n\n[The 2 Underperform Ratings](https://preview.redd.it/172gxd93lfo61.png?width=1404&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;s=b4448e07eef9f839a156716e982e53f14db92849)\n\n2.) Now guess who loaded up massively on PLTR shares for the last reporting date. I'm talking the **BIGGEST** relative position increase for the last reporting date - they didn't just double or tripple down, they quintupled down. Unfortunately I can't get the exact number of shares - but my best guess is that it's an Overweight position at this point (Edit: It makes up for 21% of CS Asset Management LLC‚Äòs portfolio - Check Edit 2 - wowzaaaa)\n\n[Credit Suisse with the BIGGEST relative position increase in the last reporting period - PLTR is CS Asset Management LLC‚Äòs biggest position accounting for 21&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#37; of their Portfolio \\(Check Edit 2 for more on that\\)](https://preview.redd.it/3ci8uk87lfo61.png?width=1413&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;s=26d896e80c2f8fde57ad285d6f064a1c7e149181)\n\nNow - in which subsidiary of Credit Suisse does said analyst Chew, Yaoxian work?\n\n[He's a VP at Credit Suisse Asset Management, LLC \\(US\\) - yep](https://preview.redd.it/zlfu1bxdlfo61.png?width=1819&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;s=3ddbd45cd5ab4121ad880669fb51f4570bd19d30)\n\nLittle sidenote: If you had invested based on mister Chew's analysis, you would've made a whopping -8% return for the past 3 years! *Blacklisted the guy.*\n\nMister Bhavan's ratings don't look a lot better.\n\nIf you're reading this Chew - shame on you and if you wanna boost your accuracy and recommendation performance - maybe do your job and post an actual analysis, not just one that serves to spread negative sentiment in the hopes of lowering your cost basis. I bet you don't give two shits about actually doing your job though.\n\n3.) Now let's have a look at William Blair's trades.\n\n[No comment](https://preview.redd.it/3nbo9hmemfo61.png?width=1118&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;s=8cdc305208a842b497abb06c9a253501621be67f)\n\n[Bhavan Suri's Ratings not looking too rosy either.](https://preview.redd.it/74w7rwxamfo61.png?width=1796&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;s=0d31456fba6a1716e9ab971fdccc01bb0fdfa536)\n\nLet's have a look at William Blair's disclosure:\n\nOfficers and employees of William Blair or its affiliates (other than research analysts) mayhave a financial interest in the securities of Palantir Technologies Inc.. \n\n**(NO SHIT)**\n\nThis whole thing is just bullshit and I seriously question why these guys are even allowed to issue forecasts.\n\n**TLDR:** \nCS and William Blair analysts are issuing sell/underperform ratings while massively loading up on PLTR stonks.\n\nThe only analysts I trust on this one are the GS analysts - the rest are full of BS, giving Sell recommendations while loading up on the respective stonks themselves. If you issue a sell recommendation, well then at least put your money where your mouth is. Not like mister Chew was just some low tier analyst who couldn't affect the decision of his firm to buy or sell PLTR shares - he's a VP at CS USA LLC - Chinese wall, my ass. **Their DDs and PTs are literally worthless.** Do your own DD, don't even look at the analyst ratings or if you do, look at their track record and question if they're pursuing some alterior motive. \nI've literally seen DDs on WSB that have been more accurate than these *professional* forecasts. This just goes to show that these guys are just trying to load up on more stonks at a lower cost basis by spreading negative sentiment. It's infuriating - I am legitimately pissed and hope that more people see this blatant bullshittery.\n\n[At least Goldman gives honest ratings and their actions are in line with the recommendations they issue. - Issue a buy rating - load up on stonks. Issue a sell rating - sell the stonks. How fucking hard can it be.](https://preview.redd.it/zi72enzenfo61.png?width=1413&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;s=3201e3eeb872eedba58f33ce9e1a797e240051b5)\n\n**Edit: Valuation Concerns**\n\nI see some people saying they're currently grossly over-valued. If compared to some of their peers I'd disagree, there might be some inflation but that's due to future expectations. 47% Sale's Growth last year, IBM partnering up with PLTR is bigger than it may sound at first glance - IBM has been in the game for decades and surely have the resources to create some beautiful things but they've given up competing against PLTR.\n\n[If you look at the recently listed peers \\(Snowflake, Datadog, Dynatrace\\) - they're not as grossly overvalued as one might think given the hype they've gotten recently. They just have to \\\\\"grow\\\\\" into that market cap and beyond, which I have no doubt they will. Also have a look at the EPS - the recently listed ones \\(except for Dynatrace\\) all have negative EPS \\(PLTR in fact did have positive earnings at one point, but they're just re-investing everything and growing aggressively\\).](https://preview.redd.it/vgmc4kiq2go61.png?width=1181&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;s=6c0e3bf371c8d6fbc921d51905d710463af3fa82)\n\nAlso: if you deduct the stock based compensation from FY2020‚Äòs net loss (which is sound as it‚Äòs not a recurring cost), they‚Äòve actually netted a profit. I might do a more extensive DD on the Financials and have a deeper look into the shareholder‚Äòs portfolios to show the conviction of the individual shareholders.\n\nIf they end up getting IL-6 from the DoD - they would be the first company to ever get that level of clearance. That would attract other governments like the UK, France, Germany etc. (I bet some of those are already in discussions with PLTR). Government Contracts made up for around 50% of revenues last year. So even more revenue growth and more partnerships (which means higher revenue stability). They're also expanding into the private sector. I see a lot of upside but given the current market environment (high treasury yields - uncertainty about future inflation developments...) it might take a while.\n\nu/Ada_Diamonds did a [great DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lkngg9/former_pltr_engineer_dd_part_2_usability/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf) on the future potential of PLTR - so just check that one out. It's not very financy, more from a practical PoV which imo makes more sense in valuating these companies - no way you'd value TSLA, PLTR, SNOW etc. with your traditional DCF/Multiples methods.\n\n**Edit 2 - CS Securities USA and William Blair - Broker-Dealer/MM role:**\n\nu/McKoijion brought up a fair point in saying that the aforementioned Credit Suisse subsidiary has a broker dealer role and hence does not hold those stonks to profit from them, they hold them to facilitate trade - which is partly true. The shares were acquired via Credit Suisse Securities and are currently held by CS Asset Management LLC who have a Low turnover rate (meaning they usually hold securities for a long period of time). Credit Suisse Asset Management LLC is the top 20th Institutional Shareholder. Their biggest position is PLTR (21% - the next largest position is ~10%, now that‚Äôs some insitutional YOLO like I‚Äôve never seen it before. Obviously they‚Äôll trade some shares to the other CS subsidiaries, I don‚Äôt expect them to have 20% of their portfolio in PLTR when the next filings get released). That imo has nothing to do with them being PLTR's IPO partners alongside GS and MS - neither GS nor MS have that weighting on PLTR stock.\n\n[Credit Suisse Asset Management - top 20 institutional holder](https://preview.redd.it/lg08skyt4go61.png?width=381&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;s=b397365437263c8d1ddb7917a702ea0aa60d2ace)\n\n[Credit Suisse Asset Management - Top position PLTR](https://preview.redd.it/xu3o7acu5go61.png?width=755&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;s=9aa0ebfc2ee049e5ec2a900e4e73e4645b6c4087)\n\nAs to William Blair - They're an actual Asset Manager, no MM or Broker-Dealer role there - pretty straightforward, they're just holding.\n\nI‚Äòm not American so not really legally obliged to say this but just for the sake of formality: This is not financial advice, I just like the stock","created_utc":"2021-03-21 15:39:48","num_comments":224,"score":736,"upvote_ratio":0.89,"is_original_content":false,"permalink":"/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ma4b3b/pltr_analyst_ratings_fud_bad_faith_and_abusing/","title":"PLTR Analyst Ratings - FUD, Bad Faith and abusing their analyst positions","author":"kronos-arcanum","firstseen":"2021-03-24 21:45:27.536414"}

As part of the deal, Tidal board member and shareholder Jay-Z is expected to join\nSquare‚Äôs board. Much of Cash App‚Äôs recent success has come from Square‚Äôs efforts to build\nout ancillary services on the platform, and this could provide another tie-in.

At this point, a bit more than half of its payment volume comes from merchants\ngenerating over $125,000 in annual gross payment volume.\n\nüöÄ\n\nAdditionally, the company is making significant progress in cross-selling ancillary services, such as\nInstant Deposit and Square Capital, into its merchant client base. Tthe move upstream and\ncross-selling will allow Square to materially improve margins in the years ahead and show the viability\nof its business model. Square is a narrow-moat niche operator, not a disrupter, with market\nshare limited by its relatively high pricing and long-term margins constrained by its relative lack of scale.\nThe company's effort to build out a consumer business surrounding its Cash App creates some option\nvalue. However, Square is competing in a space with winner-take-all dynamics, and its competitors\nhave large consumer customer bases. That said, Cash App's relative performance has been strong,\nsuggesting it is positioning itself to be a survivor.\n\nüöÄ\n\nTldr;;\n\nThe ongoing shift toward electronic payments has created, and will continue to create, room for\nacquirers to see strong growth without stealing share from each other. Ancillary services are becoming a more critical engine for growth and will help Square fully monetize its\nmerchant client base and improve margins. Electronic payment growth is shifting overseas, and Square‚Äôs business model looks portable into\ninternational markets, as the company does not rely on a large local salesforce to attract merchants.\n\n\nüöÄüöÄüöÄ\n\nTldr;;tldr;;\nüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ\n\n\n[Square position 1](https://ibb.co/j6FnYNN)\n[SQuare position 2 ](https://i.postimg.cc/tCgFbNvP/Screenshot-20210321-155739.jpg)","created_utc":"2021-03-21 13:26:27","num_comments":23,"score":66,"upvote_ratio":0.81,"is_original_content":false,"permalink":"/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ma1gq0/dd_4_sq/","title":"DD 4 SQ","author":"dankantspelle","firstseen":"2021-03-24 21:45:27.538330"}

Wasn't AMC stuck at the $8 level just 2 weeks prior? If you were to ask me during the first week of March would I be happy to see AMC reach 12 and beyond by quadruple witching March 19, I'd be ecstatic if $14 can be established as the new base.\n\nHere's why this $14 is a new base. Biggest white elephant in the AMC room was when Wanda Group converted all the [B shares to A](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1411579/000110465921012939/tm215134d1_8k.htm). With about [44 million A common shares](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-wanda-group-trimming-holdings-142528503.html) that you know Wanda is itching to cash out, Wanda Group was always a threat how they would be disposing of their shares. Well this Friday March 19, what many people did not notice was a flash block trade at 2 seconds after closing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[spot the elephant leaving the room?](https://preview.redd.it/qpq8gw220fo61.png?width=607&format=png&auto=webp&s=23166f1766cabe53fee69c8975190469cffa8e76)\n\nThat's 45 million shares at 13.93 totaling $630 million. Ladies and gentlemen, Wanda has left the building. So we should be thankful that Wanda did not recklessly dump their shares in the market. Instead they found a banker or bankers to take up the entire 45M share quota. I'm guessing it's Goldman Sachs and B. Riley Securities since those two were of critical help during their [cash crisis in Nov last year](https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/amc-entertainment-to-issue-20-million-shares-of-common-stock-61282394).\n\nThis share deal doesn't happen instantly, but takes days or weeks to negotiate. It's an educated but realistic guess that Wanda has been wanting to sell it shares and would be happy at a $15 range. Just follow Silverlake who also immediately on January 27 converted their [$600 million](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001411579/000119312521022799/d30907dsc13da.htm) debt into common share at 13.51 and immediately sold into the market starting at what price? 13.55 - 14.5 range then all the way up to $24. Don't know how they sold 200k shares at $24 but that's what is filed.\n\nSo Wanda wanted to follow Silverlake's lead but were just too late when they filed the papers to [convert on Feb1](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001411579/000110465921012939/tm215134d1_8k.htm). Luckily they waited instead of just dumping, until AMC revived to above 10. By then they reached an agreement with bankers probably at $14. This is all guessing here and not established fact (except for that 45M block trade).\n\nBut if that's what happened, that's good for us because it means a big bank (Goldman? Riley?) is willing to take up a wholesale $630 million equity share position on AMC at 13.93 /share cost and will be retail selling these shares at 16 dollars and above? 18 dollars and above? 20 dollars and above? Once again based on Silverlake's move, they can see AMC going to 24 dollars.\n\nIf a deal was struck with Wanda at about $14, then it was imperative for them to make sure AMC stocks had to land at $14 dollars by end of Friday March 19. That's what we observed happening all day Friday trading.\n\nIf this is what happened, we should count ourselves fortunate because it's now a big banker who will be establishing $14 as the new base.\n\nGo AMC, go Apes.\n\nAll this was NOT financial advice. Just thinking out loud what I think happened with AMC these past weeks.","created_utc":"2021-03-21 13:18:19","num_comments":207,"score":676,"upvote_ratio":0.72,"is_original_content":false,"permalink":"/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ma1ao9/amc_why_its_all_good_from_fridays_quadruple/","title":"AMC why it's all good from friday's Quadruple witching hour.","author":"wallstreetwhiskers","firstseen":"2021-03-24 21:45:27.538603"}

Incredible hype, unprofitable companies, zero sales, fraud and mismanagement of investor funds.\n\nRelated to this, a week ago another EV stonk ($RIDE) was being **alleged of fraud** so I think it's time we briefly go through the EV turds you guys have been throwing money at for the past year.\n\n**Disclaimer: This is fanfiction I write at night after I drop off my wife at her boyfriends place. Not financial advice.**\n\nSome  background for the kids who weren't gambling FDs in 2018. Roughly three  years ago, back when your biggest goal in life was to see your middle  school teacher Ms. Wilson's **bare tits**,  the retards here were already YOLOing their Wendy's paychecks and  sending them over the border into Canada. Why Canada? Turns out the **maple syrup sipping beavers**  up there were about to legalize marijuana. Some of the more business  oriented folks tired of freezing their balls off decided to quit their  jobs at Tim Hortons and buy **barns in the middle of nowhere**, setup weed companies and call them cool names like \"Blaze It  Erryday Co\", \"Kush Money Inc\" and \"Aphria Inc\". The empty barns were  publicly listed on the TSX and we were off to the races! Retards like us  bought everything we could get our hands on, **weed was about to make us millionaires**.\n\nTurns out most companies shit themselves after reality set in.\n\nSales were **disappointing**, low profit margins meant that almost none of the companies were profitable, the **bubble popped** and your boys were left **holding bags** of weed(stonks). Some of these companies are still around, while others are now **lol tier pennystocks**.\n\nI  was originally going to compare the current state of EVs to the dotcom  era internet companies but only the boomers here will remember that ancient stuff  so weedstocks it is. Okay, enough with the history lessons. Here's why I  think 2018 weedstocks are a good comparison to EVs.\n\n* \"New\" industry with incredible growth expectations from investors.\n* A ton of public listings by companies in a short period of time.\n* Stonks going to the moon\n* Strong belief that these companies can actually turn a profit.\n\nLet's move on to **what's hot with the SEC** right now. I'll list some of the EV companies here and tell you why they're terrible. Note: I'm **not touching Chinese EVs**, the CCP will eventually decide which manufacturer they want to install their **spyware** into and declare the winner. Also I'm sorry if I left out the EV fraud you're holding, too bad, I'm about to **blast some ass**. I think you'll quickly see a pattern emerging with these companies.\n\n**Canoo Inc ($GOEV)**\n\n* Listed via SPAC. Not making profit.\n* Not  mass producing cars, but has plans to start producing a terrible  looking minivan in 2022. These minivans will be subscription based  revolutionary \"lifestyle experiences\". I need to know what these guys  are smoking.\n* The company estimates it will produce 95k cars per year by 2025, lmao.\n* **Rating: Lol tier**\n\n**Fisker Inc ($FSR)**\n\n* Listed via SPAC. Not making profit.\n* Not mass producing cars, but has plans to start outsourcing production of a decent looking SUV in late 2022.\n* They're  strictly using 3rd party manufacturing for their cars and using a  'leasing' type of business model, so customers will pay a monthly fee  instead of a big upfront payment. Foxconn has stated they will be able  to produce up to 250k Fisker cars around 2023. Essentially Fisker is  drawing pictures with crayons and hoping their 3rd parties can deliver.  3rd party manufacturing and business model doesn't sound that terrible, they may have some brain cells.\n* **Rating: Crayon tier**\n\n**Nikola Corp ($NKLA)**\n\n* Listed via SPAC. Not making profit.\n* Not mass producing cars, but has plans to start producing trucks in late 2023.\n* CEO resigned after fraud allegations last year. Investigated by the SEC. Also that fake truck video was hilarious.\n* Didn't  find any reliable production estimates. The company is allegedly filled  with fraud, which is why I think this company will never mass produce a  car/truck.\n* **Rating: Fraud tier**\n\n**Lordstown Motors Corp ($RIDE)**\n\n* Listed via SPAC. Not making profit.\n* Not mass producing cars, but has plans to start producing a nice looking pickup truck in late 2021.\n* Allegations of producing fake pre-orders and being years behind of schedule. Investigated by the SEC.\n* Aiming for 100k cars per year in 2024, CEO has stated their factory  has potential capacity to produce 600k cars per year.\n* **Rating: Fraud tier**\n\n**Lucid Motors ($CCIV)**\n\n* Listing Q2 2021 via SPAC. Not making profit.\n* Not mass producing cars, but has plans to start producing a very nice looking sedan in Q2 2021.\n* Factory capacity to produce 30k cars per year with plans to increase it to 400k.\n* Actually not a complete disaster but production capacity is very low at this point.\n* **Rating: ex-TSLA tier**\n\n**Tesla Inc ($TSLA)**\n\n* Did an IPO back when you kids were sucking on your **mommys nipples**. Profitable because they sell billions of regulatory credits.\n* Mass produces multiple models and has plans to start producing more models.\n* Current capacity over 800k cars per year with upcoming expansions.\n* OG memestock. Only EV company that has a **Technoking**.  Incredibly overvalued. Multiple reasons pumping valuation,  Full-Self-Driving & robotaxis being one. Go check the 8.2 beta  videos, that thing is nowhere near autonomous. \"tEsLa iS nOt a CaR  ComPanY\", okay, right.\n* **Rating: Meme tier**\n\n**In conclusion.**\n\nAlmost every single company in the \"purely\" EV space is **losing money**. Most of them **aren't producing anything**. At least a few of them are producing **fraudulent data**. Some of the founders have **terrible track records**,  look at the founders of GOEV, FSR and RIDE. This is 2018 weedstocks all  over again. Most of these companies will go away in the next 5 years as  car companies that actually sell cars begin to shift over to EV. Even  though TSLA is incredibly overvalued it looks like a 10 compared to the  other turds in the industry. Even TSLA will have to compete with Ford  and Volkswagen in the upcoming years but I'm expecting them to survive  and possibly become legit profitable at some point. If you think the EV  stonk your holding is going to moon this year, go look at what happened  with weedstocks after 2018.\n\nThank you, have a great weekend and good luck next week!\n\nI know a lot of you retards are holding these stonks so I'm prepared to receive my downvotes.\n\n**Related positions:**\n\nCurrently  I have no positions on the companies listed above except long dated  TSLA puts. I am however looking into buying puts on the other EV  companies listed above.","created_utc":"2021-03-21 11:48:56","num_comments":621,"score":987,"upvote_ratio":0.88,"is_original_content":false,"permalink":"/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m9zf3x/ev_industry_a_spac_fueled_fraud_filled_bubble/","title":"EV Industry: a SPAC fueled & fraud filled bubble","author":"The_Juice_God","firstseen":"2021-03-24 21:45:27.539637"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"605bb2f75df7eedfb49c1e3c"},"id":"m9z2dr","fullname":"t3_m9z2dr","selftext":"Options lessons part deux\n\n*As an addendum to my previous post on delta hedging*\n\nDelta hedging, pin risk, gamma, max pain: \n\n**Dynamic delta hedging** -\n\nEx: AMC a dealer sold a $14 3/19 call on 3/9 when the stock was at $10. The delta was 30% so they bought 30% of their AMC exposure and were delta neutral. As the stock moves up and down the delta changes (the rate of change is gamma). Stock moves to $11, delta goes to 40%, they buy more. Stock goes down to $9, delta goes to 20%, they sell more. \n\nThis week stock was drifting higher and $14 call sellers are buying more stock while $14 put sellers are ALSO buying. When the stock is at $10 the chance of a $14 call being ITM in a week is... 30% let‚Äôs say (much lower for a normal stock but AMC vol is obviously sky high). The chance of an $14 put being ITM is let‚Äôs say... 70%. As the stock moves higher both call and put sellers are buying stock.\nWith the stock at $13.50 the call delta goes to 48% and the put delta goes to 52% as an example. \n\nThis week a bunch of call option buyers came in bidding up higher strikes. This forced dealers to buy more stock to hedge. This causes the price to rise. Now as the price of the stock rises, so does the delta (the rate of this change is the gamma). So now the dealers have to buy MORE stock. The closer to expiry the more gamma there is in at the money (ATM) options. So dealers are buying more and more stock which is making the price go up (obviously) which means the call delta goes up which makes them buy more stock. At the same time this is happening to the whole options chain. Tada! A **gamma squeeze**. \n\nThe WHOLE time they are hedging. Obviously some of them probably couldn‚Äôt hedge fast enough and lost money but generally speaking, they are long the same amount of equity exposure as they are short through options.\n\n‚ÄúGamma squeezes‚Äù work both ways. As the stock starts to drop, those dealers are selling their stock because the probability of a $14 call being exercised is dropping. \n\n**Explaining price action Friday afternoons**:\n\nOk, so we‚Äôve discussed dynamic delta hedging and how dealers are hedging their exposure constantly. They‚Äôre not waiting until Friday at 4:00 to find out if they‚Äôre on the hook for millions of dollars.\n\nLet‚Äôs keep using AMC as an example. Here comes Friday/ expiry and the stock is right around $14.  Lots and lots of contracts are being closed out for profits/ losses and dealers are unwinding hedges.\n\nDealers short calls all the way up to $13.50 are almost 100% hedged (they‚Äôve bought almost 100% of their stock). The probability the calls they are short will be ITM is almost 100%. Dealers short calls from let‚Äôs say.... $14.50 and up are almost 0% hedged (in a normal situation this would be actually 0. For AMC it was non zero) \n\nReminder: A LOT of this is being unwound on Friday. Lots of positions are getting closed out and dealers are buying/ selling/ shorting stock to stay neutral. As the day goes on the dealers short $13.50 calls are buying more stock to get to 100% hedged and the dealers short $14.50 calls are selling more stock to get to 0% hedged.\n\n*(By Friday afternoon having a lot of open interest in higher $ strikes starts to work against longs. ‚ÄúCharm‚Äù is causing the delta on those OTM calls to drop by the minute.)*\n\nThe problem for the dealer short the $14 call is that as the stock pinballs back and forth from $13.95 and $14.05  the probability of the call being ITM is going from 100% to 0% to 100% to 0%. (Gamma is huge here. It‚Äôs the rate of change of the delta. It‚Äôs changing a lot!)\n\n**Right around $14 it‚Äôs a huge question mark** whether remaining open call and put options will be exercised or not (reflected in the delta being right around 50% - it‚Äôs a 50/50 chance). The dealer doesn‚Äôt know if it should be 100% hedged or 0% hedged! Probabilistically they should be 50% hedged. But if the stock gaps down at 3:59:58 the call seller is over hedged and if it spikes at 3:59:58 they are under hedged. If the stock closes at $13.95, calls won‚Äôt be exercised, they don‚Äôt need to have shares. If the stock closes at $14.05 calls will be exercised, they need to have shares. So heading into the close they are selling every time the stock goes below $14 and buying every time it goes above $14. Yes, they are buying high and selling low. They sold options thus are short vol/ short gamma.\n\nOn the other hand if dealers are LONG calls or puts they are doing the opposite. A dealer long a $14 put wants to be long 100% of their exposure at $13.98 and 0% at $14.02. So they are long vol, and buying low and selling high.\n\nSo. The reason you‚Äôll see a spike in volume if there is large OI in ATM options is due to a) people closing out their contracts at gains/ losses (remember very few options are actually exercised) \nb) lots and lots of dealer hedging in both directions. \n\nThere is an all out battle between call and put buyers and sellers heading into expiry. Generally if dealers are net short vol you‚Äôll see the stock drift away from the strike on high volume. If they‚Äôre net long vol you‚Äôll see the stock stay pinned near the strike price. (but delta hedging isn‚Äôt the only thing happening in the market! This is all happening in the middle of regular buying and selling!) A lot of times a big-ish movement right before the close is dealers capitulating and getting squared to be 100% hedged or 0% hedged. Nobody is leaving their desk Friday afternoon potentially long or short millions of extra shares.\n\n**Max pain theory**- the theory that the stock will settle at a price that causes the ‚Äúmaximum pain‚Äù to option holders, ie where the most dollars at risk end up out of the money. https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/maxpain.asp This was actually $10 yesterday so it didn‚Äôt totally apply https://swaggystocks.com/dashboard/options-max-pain/SPY (Don‚Äôt get cute and try to trade off this, you‚Äôll end up losing money.) BUT there was a lot of OI in $14 so while not quite ‚ÄúMax pain,‚Äù the stock ending the day below $14 did cause ‚Äúpain‚Äù to some remaining call holders. GME Max pain was $150, but there was ‚Äúpain‚Äù for remaining $200 put holders.\n\n*It‚Äôs also quite possible that there really was a large natural seller at $14. Again, this is not manipulation.*\n\n**The pin risk ‚Äúproblem‚Äù** revolves around expiry. If the stock closes at $13.95 someone will likely want to exercise their put and sell their stock at $14 (5c above market). If the stock closes at $14.05 someone will likely not want to exercise their put and sell their stock at $14 (.05 below market). Sellers of options that are ATM on expiry face some uncertainty that is almost impossible to hedge. If the stock is bouncing around $13.95 or $$14.05 or $13.99 it becomes extremely difficult to predict if the option will be exercised. Most brokers ‚Äúauto-exercise‚Äù any option that is ITM by .01. BUT option holders have until 5:30 PM on Friday to instruct their brokers. They can call their brokers and instruct ‚ÄúDNE‚Äù- do not exercise. This often happens if the stock moves after hours. \n\n*IE, you own a $14 AMC put. Stock closes at $13.93 on Friday and you‚Äôre in the money. At 4:05 it‚Äôs announced that AMZN is buying AMC at $20 a share. You call your broker and scream ‚Äúdo not exercise!!‚Äù \n\n*You own a $200 GME call. Stock closes at $200.27 and you‚Äôre in the money. At 4:05 it‚Äôs announced that GME is going bankrupt. You call your broker and scream ‚Äúdo not exercise!!‚Äù\nMore likely a bunch of idiots bought $200 calls and don‚Äôt have the cash to take delivery so the options aren‚Äôt exercised. \n\nSome brokers charge a fee to exercise which further muddies the waters. But the real risk which is difficult to hedge is that option holders have until 5:30 to instruct brokers and a lot can happen from 4:00 to 5:30. So dealers do have some incentive to push the price to where options won‚Äôt be exercised so they aren‚Äôt taking some weekend risk. The dollars here are small though... it‚Äôs not, ‚Äúif it closes above $200 I‚Äôm screwed and have to buy millions of dollars of stock,‚Äù it‚Äôs ‚Äúif it closes above $200 there‚Äôs still some uncertainty on whether I‚Äôll be assigned on some calls that are still open so I‚Äôm taking some weekend risk.‚Äù **MOST of the options have already been closed out before 4 PM. Most options buyers do not exercise.**\n\nOn SATURDAY the OCC auto exercises all options that are valid and have not gotten a DNE and randomly assigns the contracts to its members (brokers). In turn, brokers randomly assign the contracts among all the option sellers. \n\nSo there IS usually some overhang on Monday in both directions. But it‚Äôs really very small. And then it‚Äôs a new week and we‚Äôre off to the races again :) \n\nThank you for coming to my Ted talk.","created_utc":"2021-03-21 11:31:30","num_comments":49,"score":109,"upvote_ratio":0.75,"is_original_content":false,"permalink":"/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m9z2dr/options_lessons_part_deux/","title":"Options lessons part deux","author":"Verb0182","firstseen":"2021-03-24 21:45:27.539918"}

Okay, so I looked at this on Thursday when it was announced that kid died, and the stock was closer to 100. That said, I still think this has room to grow, and once the price dips again I'm personally going to load up on calls. I think 120 is a good target. I'm on the fence between doing the April or May calls, but I think May is the safer play. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, I know most DD just has tons of analysis and actual information and walls of text and shit, but here's a pretty chart. 1year chart with bands and the weighted moving average.

But the stock rose like 8 bucks on the news their treadmill killed a kid, so if that's good enough for the market, that's good enough for me. Let's give Becky a ride, and get in on the PTON action.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think there is a good chance their earning call is rough, because my understanding is to unfuck their logistics, they decided to air freight all their hardware to clear the backlog. Sure, selling more bikes is a good thing, but everyone knows logistics is where the money is. So feel free to inverse me with some confidence too.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR 4/16 Calls @ 120 because the May ones are 3x the price","created_utc":"2021-03-21 11:20:17","num_comments":29,"score":0,"upvote_ratio":0.42,"is_original_content":false,"permalink":"/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m9yudj/pton_not_just_a_becky_meme_stock/","title":"PTON - Not Just a Becky Meme stock?","author":"noob_tube03","firstseen":"2021-03-24 21:45:27.540233"}

If Hedge Funds can't get below 170, getting it below 200 is imperative for them as the spread begins to get out of hand.\n\nTotal Calls and Puts ITM stays steady from 170 to 200, however that number begins to increase dramatically beyond 200.

Otherwise all the OPEC countries would literally go bust.\n\n2019 oil production was \\~101 million barrels per day.\n\nTo-date OPEC has still has a 7.5 million barrel cut on oil. Becuase they want to see REAL demand and REAL growth from economies before they increase supply again.\n\n**Let‚Äôs do some intense math: 101-7.5 = 93.5 million barrels per day of current production.**\n\n**Hmmmm**\n\nWhat is current consumption?\n\nLook at the pretty circle below.

Obviously during Covid it fell off a cliff as you can see by the blue line below falling off a cliff. It dropped by about 10%.\n\nSo I equated that roughly to about 3.5 million barrels of oil per day. This pickup in driving has yet to come back. It has not yet reverted to mean.

Althought airline industry only uses like 8 million barrels of oil per day (out of total pre-COVID of 101) it is still significant.\n\nPretty chart below shows number of flights per day (thousands). As you can see, pre-COVID it dropped a lot, and now is still down 40%. Which equates to a 3.2 million barrels per day missing that has yet to revert to mean.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[flights](https://preview.redd.it/z81qnzma4co61.png?width=612&format=png&auto=webp&s=7a5bf4453240718cf211f5203445c08f3af19422)\n\n# Let‚Äôs summarise:\n\n1.

{"_id":{"$oid":"605bb2f75df7eedfb49c1e42"},"id":"m9mkzg","fullname":"t3_m9mkzg","selftext":"Hi everyone, this is my take on Palantir. I've been writing this for a couple weeks now and decide that I need to get this done today so hopefully it reads well. This post is my personal opinion and analysis. Welcome any questions and constructive feedback. For full disclosure I invest in PLTR and nothing beats doing your own research in addition to reading other people's DDs.\n\n**Deep value investment for the most important software company, PT $45 EOFY:**\n\nI believe Palantir has been and will continue to disrupt not just the software industry but how dozens of sectors and industries operate. What we‚Äôre seeing here might be the next Amazon with a company that does not mind short-term losses and invests aggressively to achieve long-term hyper and exponential growth. If you look at companies that shy away from making such a level of investments into technology to please their shareholders in the short-term, such short-sighted actions do no justice for those wanting to hold onto their investments over the medium- to long-term. I am incredibly excited about the recent Titan release with 4 new modules that includes an AI assistant and an automatic reporting tool. My target price for PLTR is $45 EOFY, key modelling assumptions include:\n\n* Palantir will be a +$20bn revenue business by 2030, driven by significant growth in number of customers and revenue per customer, partially offset by 1-2% churn each year. Growth rate +30% over the long-term is consistent with what we've seen with Amazon / AWS and Salesforce. There will be increasing demand for data analytics solutions and full stack operating systems like Palantir as corporate/governments undergo transformations and identify new use cases for the data that they have.\n* Gross margin around 74%, in line with most other software companies.\n* Exponential growth and margin support by Apollo's automation of the implementation and post-implementation support would enable massive implementation across thousands of large-to-medium-size customers that would otherwise not be possible with the current headcount at Palantir. Like Alex Karp said, software allows small companies to compete against rivals 10x their size.\n* EBIT margin will expand to 27% (including stock-based compensation) by 2030. This is conservative when we compare to MSFT which is operating at +35%. I also assume a normalised 18% on sales & marketing which is on the low side if you compare to CRM at 40-45%, but given Palantir's current partnership model I think this is justifiable. 17% R&D and 5% General & admin.\n* Significant shareholder dilution going forward. I use a share base of 2.2-2.3B for my per share calculation to factor in the dilution. Assume no share buyback.\n* Normalisation of interest rates to 3% and lower beta (basically lower volatility) over the next 10 years.\n\nNote that while my PT is definitely lower than other moonshots on this sub (I'm talking 60/100/150/500), this is based on readily available datapoints, moderately conservative assumptions and assuming investors will not be willing to pay crazy multiples for the stock.\n\n**Management is sandbagging revenue guidance, are we doing the same?** Management has been overly-conservative and this was one of the main factors causing the share price to tank following what I would consider a very positive Q4 and FY20. With 45% revenue growth for Q1 and 30% for FY21, this implies that Palantir has to really mess up a lot of things in one or two of the remaining quarters (y/y growth below 20-30%) to miss or even to just achieve their guidance. Below is an analysis I've done to show if their guidance is true they will grow at \\~19% y/y in one of the quarters which isn't great. So it is more likely than not these guys will outperform their revenue guidance by a significant margin this year. With their 2025 revenue guidance of $4bn, I believe this is also very conservative and it is not difficult to believe the annual growth rate can be 35-40% y/y instead of the guided 30% CAGR. By 2030, at the current rate of growth plus a bit of uplift this business can get to $20bn in revenue or even $30bn ‚Äì such growth is not unheard of if you‚Äôve been following Amazon / AWS and see what they‚Äôve achieved. Also, the TAM for PLTR might be a lot larger than what management has guided (I note from [C3.AI](http://c3.ai/) filing that they estimate their market opportunities to be in the range of $240bn and growing) but of course penetration of that TAM will prove challenging for Palantir.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[FY21 revenue scenario, Assume Q2 and Q3 both grow at 30&#37; y\\/y, this means Q4 grows at 19&#37; y\\/y](https://preview.redd.it/4nu7jwnynao61.png?width=1616&format=png&auto=webp&s=ef8bd9288faf885fca364e9e837ee28946216231)\n\nOn another note, in FY21-22, we might see a significant number of customers entering the Expand and Scale phases. In 2020, Palantir had been able to acquire 400+ new Acquire customers on top of the existing \\~125, making their customer pool 500+ at the lower end. If they manage to convert all of these new Acquire to Expand/Scale that would add +$4bn to their top line, assuming each customer roughly pays $10m a year to Palantir for the software.\n\n**This business can become extremely profitable.** While both Alex and Cathie have focused their attention on investing more into the business by forgoing profitability now, in the long-term all businesses need to be profitable so I don't suggest we ignore profitability completely. The case might be that Palantir can become a lot more profitable than what we currently see with the level of automation Apollo and future add-ons can handle. Operating leverage will also enable PLTR to expand their margins. In a bull case, gross margin and operating margin may expand to +75% and 30-35% respectively as stock-based compensation further normalises in the future. R&D, sales & marketing and other expenses will still grow in absolute terms but will eventually become smaller portions of revenue.\n\n**Future stock-based compensation will improve.** From PLTR‚Äôs SEC filing, I was able to get a sense of what the stock-based compensation will be over the next 3-4 years. I forecast stock-based compensation will reduce from $1.1bn in FY20 to \\~$414m per year over FY21-23. I also looked at the stock-based compensation expense of other software companies to make sure that there is nothing odd going on with Palantir (see figure below). For my modelling I assume that over the long-term, stock-based compensation will stabilise around 8% of revenue (which is a lot lower than companies like ServiceNow but still above average for well established software companies). Besides the financial, it is noted that stock-based compensation allows Palantir to attract the best people as well as providing their people with incentives to further their contributions to the business.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Arithmetic mean for FY10-21 stock-based compensation &#37; of revenue for selected software companies. Source: manual data entry from 10K\\/S1 filings](https://preview.redd.it/591tejo3oao61.png?width=1034&format=png&auto=webp&s=c52b0a4f04b6ac00f65610ff44bd34f7348def57)\n\n**How long is long-term?** With a stock like Palantir, it seems to be the case that Alex Karp's horizon is beyond 5 years, possibly 6-7 years. The trajectory of the stock will likely be sideway for long and moon/mars long into the future. The point when they reach profitability will be key to the moon phenomenon, which I'd say they can be profitable earliest 2023, base case 2025. So just to reiterate the same thing that Alex Karp has said but cater to our short-termism a bit better, if you're a short-term investor with possibly less than 2 years investment horizon in this stock (2 years is at the very least) then I'd go for SPACs or follow meetkevin investments....\n\n**Key challenges to Palantir:**\n\nWe know Palantir has a very good product, but there is much to prove with its business model. Below I note some key challenges:\n\n* **Relationship with IBM and Amazon:** It is great that Palantir has been able to secure two very good partnerships with two juggernauts. However, the level of leverage that Palantir can pull in these partnerships is weak imo as Palantir is still very small and has limited capacity to push through sales. Over time, I'd expect Palantir to become increasingly independent from IBM and Amazon, with the two only providing the hardware and cloud infrastructure for Palantir and Palantir to substantially upscale its direct salesforce to capture more share of the market.\n* **Competition:** Though we may say the TAM is $120bn, $500bn, $1T or even $2T, it is clear Palantir won't capture the entire TAM. Organisations may continue to use their existing systems or choose another vendor. Palantir's potential customers may not have the same horizon as Alex Karp's and they may opt for quick one-off solutions rather than a long-term commitment to Gotham/Foundry/etc. Such level of inertia will slow down adoption of Palantir's products. There might be other companies jumping into this space. I do note however that it will also be challenging for other companies to compete against Palantir, especially the bigger players as their large structure prevents them from investing sufficiently for what is still viewed as a niche market.\n* **Shareholder dilution:** Part of the reason why it seems PLTR share price does not go up as much on green days is the market pricing in the dilution. While we may think the share base to calculate the per share valuation is 1.83B, there's 500-700m more shares that will eventually dilute the stock, lowering the per share valuation (assuming no share buyback). This factor is also the main driver of the discrepancy in the PT that people have for PLTR, not really revenue and operating income by themselves alone. I note that this dilution is common for many companies but it is however very significant for Palantir. Valuation needs to consider dilution.\n* **Transparency into financial disclosures:** Palantir currently does not have the best disclosures in their 10K/10Q/S1 if one has spent time looking at other software companies' SEC filings. For one, there is no breakdown between software and services in their revenue which makes it hard to understand how much of their revenue is coming from the actual software. The stock-based compensation structure is difficult for investors to grasp that somewhat have hidden the significant level of dilution that we're going to see in the future (that compounds with the investor base dominated by retail). The Acquire/Expand/Scale disclosure does not exactly show how many customers have moved from Acquire into Expand and so on. Overall, Palantir can do a lot better in their financial reporting.\n* **Public relations:** In my opinion Palantir has not exactly done its best in terms of communications to its investors and obviously maintaining good relationships with the media and Wall Street. While Alex Karp may like the fact that retail investors are dominating the base, I think a more balanced investor base with growing interest from institutional investors will be healthy for the stock (which is actually what we're seeing more of). Good relationships with Wall Street will be key in balancing the investor base. This is not saying PLTR to forgo all of its long-term values but rather they should engage with Wall Street in more regular and healthy debates that will benefit both Palantir and the St, and giving the St more opportunities to understand the company better. This is also not saying Wall St should all put BUY ratings on PLTR because they have the right to have their own view, but a good relationship will give any PT and rating a more objective touch. In terms of communications, I envision Palantir to somewhat move in the direction of Salesforce which has done very well in this regards by developing free online courses and low-code/no-code chill-out conversations that investors/layman can jump in. This would further Palantir along the adoption curve and make Palantir a household name. Recently, the Titan release is not known unless someone goes through multiple loops to find the link so such release should have been announced publicly either via the News section or on Twitter.\n\n**Palantir is still trading cheap compared to some of the recently listed software companies**\n\nPrice/Sales or P/S is the key metric for a company like Palantir. Anyway, you can see that Palantir is trading cheaper than 6 other companies at 41x (Snowflake, Crowdstrike, Roblox, Zscaler, C3 AI and Datadog), 4 of which have an average BUY rating from analysts. One thing to bear in mind though is that the whole tech sector has been trading rich for a while now so it is uncertain at this stage to know whether there will be a correction/normalization of multiples in a rising interest rates / inflationary environment. In other words, will 20x P/S be the new normal? Or +40x P/S will be here to stay, let's hope for the latter.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Software comparables Price\\/Sales ratio.

Going forward, I'd continue to monitor the stock and might come up with another DD (if anyone has an idea then let me know). One key area that I'd be interested in would be corporate governance and benchmark that against other practices in the software industry.","created_utc":"2021-03-20 22:44:47","num_comments":323,"score":894,"upvote_ratio":0.87,"is_original_content":false,"permalink":"/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m9mkzg/palantir_there_and_back_again_pt_45_eofy/","title":"Palantir: There and Back Again - PT $45 EOFY","author":"Available-Row7494","firstseen":"2021-03-24 21:45:27.541642"}

They are not willing to sit back and watch naked short sellers, funded by big banks, manipulate stocks, harm companies, and fleece shareholders.\n\n> The battle that launched this week over GameStop between retail investors and Wall Street-backed naked short sellers is the beginning of a war that could change everything.\n\n> It‚Äôs a global problem, but **it poses the greatest threat to Canadian capital markets**, where naked short selling‚Äîthe process of selling shares you don‚Äôt own, thereby creating counterfeit or ‚Äòphantom‚Äô shares‚Äîsurvives and remains under the regulatory radar because Broker-Dealers do not have to report failing trades until they exceed 10 days.\n\n> This is an egregious act against capital markets, and it‚Äôs caused billions of dollars in damage.\n\n> Make no mistake about the enormity of this threat: Both foreign and domestic schemers have attacked Canada in an effort to bring down the stock prices of its publicly listed companies.\n\nAlso:\n\n> And big banks and financial institutions are turning a blind eye to some of the accounts that routinely participate in these illegal transactions because of the large fees they collect from them. These institutions are actively facilitating the destruction of shareholder value in return for short term windfalls in the form of trading fees. They are a major part of the problem and are complicit in aiding these accounts to create counterfeit shares.\n\nFocus:\n\n> Their MO is to short weak, vulnerable companies by putting out negative reports that drive down their share price as much as possible. This ensures that the shorted company in question no longer has the ability to obtain financing, putting them at the mercy of the same funds that were just shorting them. **After cratering the shorted company‚Äôs share price, the funds then start offering these companies financing usually through convertibles with a warrant attachment** as a hedge (or potential future cover) against their short; and the companies take the offers because they have no choice left. Rinse and Repeat.\n\nThis predatory short activity by hedge funds did, in fact, happen to Canadian pot stocks before the COVID crash last year.\n\nWhich other Canadian stocks are being attacked like this?\n\nMoving on:\n\n> McMillan also noted that ‚Äúthe number of short campaigns in Canada is utterly disproportionate to the size of our capital markets when compared to the United States, the European Union, and Australia‚Äù.","created_utc":"2021-03-20 21:47:49","num_comments":375,"score":1560,"upvote_ratio":0.96,"is_original_content":false,"permalink":"/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m9lkim/naked_short_selling_is_worse_in_canada/","title":"Naked Short Selling is worse in Canada","author":"Torlek1","firstseen":"2021-03-24 21:45:27.542257"}

I‚Äôve just started denting my brain by understanding how Fails to Deliver are hid in Out of the Money calls or puts or whatever and now I got to try and understand Payment for Order Flow?! Its like studying for the SAT and then someone knocks on the door and tells you, by the way, you are taking the MCATS tomorrow morning. WTF?!\n\nSo, apparently PFOF was started by Madoff! I think on the surface it looks legit, but it is easily used for wicked purposes by moving it to dark pools and off market buys, which explains why there is so much buying but it doesn‚Äôt move the ticker at all, while sells plummet it in seconds. I guess the SEC looks at this and says, ‚Äòoh cool, this was started by Madoff and is now industry standard, nothing to see here, would you like a sensual hand job or an angry one‚Äô? Is this why Wall Street and Main Street haven‚Äôt been the same street in a long time? Since 2008? Earlier?\n\nIts starting to feel like Wall Street is one big Ponzi scheme, I know we all know that, but when it happens for real its terrifying! Madoff has been butt fucking everyone since the early eighties, how deep does this rabbit hole go, how deep is his dick still in our rabbit hole?\n\nThis is my favorite part of his Wiki.\n\n\"Madoff founded a¬†penny stock¬†brokerage¬†in 1960 which eventually grew into Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities. He served as its chairman until his arrest on December 11, 2008.\\[6\\]\\[7\\]¬†The firm was one of the top market maker businesses on Wall Street,\\[8\\]¬†which bypassed \"specialist\" firms by directly executing orders¬†over the counter¬†from retail brokers.\" FUCKING GREAT!!!\n\nThen I went digging around and looking at the brokers who adopted this. And holy fucking shit, its almost all of them! TD Ameritrade where all of my funds are at are listed, and Vanguard\\* who I was hoping to transfer to. And now I got to sweat moving my shares from TD, something that makes me extremely nervous, thinking that I might miss out on the rocket launch I‚Äôve been so patiently waiting on.\n\nAny talk about moving from TD is simply not on here, lots of talk about Robinhood and Fidelity, but any questions about TD and I get down voted to oblivion. So much FUD, so little time...\n\nI remember when Apes figured out shorts were being hid in ETF‚Äôs and how big of a bomb that was, this PFOF stuff feels bigger! I don‚Äôt think its getting the attention it deserves because we haven‚Äôt had any time to catch our breath from all the other bombs dropped, short ETF‚Äôs, hidden FTD‚Äôs etc. Good luck ever getting this talked about in Congress, they can hardly even address Naked Short‚Äôs. They are still learning arithmetic when we need to be discussing Calculus!\n\nI‚Äôm so angry and frustrated and I don‚Äôt know who to blame. Citadel? SEC? Madoff? Myself for being so ignorant on what‚Äôs going on? I‚Äôm so confused and hoping some big brain apes can help. I‚Äôm just a homeless filmmaker, aren‚Äôt real adults supposed to be in charge of looking into this? What‚Äôs next, I wake up and there is Morpheus telling me to see with my real eyes? Have I become as crazy as all my friends and family think I am about GME? Have we become QAnon? WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON?!!!\n\nThis really is the biggest fraud in history and we are the only ones talking about it, isn‚Äôt it? This is Madoff, only this time, Madoff is all of Wall Street!\n\nIs every broker dealing with PFOF a toxic dumping ground? Is it worth it to move from TD? How long will it truly take? Is every broker fucked? Are we all fucked? All of these institutions are saying, ‚Äòhey, trust me with your money, I learned everything I know from Bernie Madoff‚Äô.\n\nFUCK! SHIT! FUCK! I want out! And I don‚Äôt know who to trust!\n\nI‚Äôm angry, scared, exhilarated‚Ä¶ Fuck it, no matter what, if I miss the rocket, if it explodes, if it launches me at 30 G‚Äôs into the sun, this has been a wild ride and well worth it. I hope I know what I‚Äôm doing, I hope that you do too. But, most of all, I hope that this changes things for the better! I hope all of you Apes are rewarded and safe on your Rocket ride!\n\nI‚Äôm so confused and don‚Äôt know who to trust. The only thing I know is that I believe in the DD and I believe in you fellow Apes.\n\nAny thoughts would be greatly appreciated, Peace and HODL!\n\nTL;DR I think Madoff cut his teeth with fraud with PFOF before moving to bigger fraud feeding off the whales, in the mean time, Wall Street adopted his fraud methods with PFOF feeding off of retail. It really is a big Ponzi scheme.\n\n**Addendum:** You know the phrase, it isn't a loss until you sell? I think in Citadels' mind, it also isn't a buy, until you sell!

We have all seen the amazing DD's floating around, talking about how amazing the company is. Now let's talk about some of the catalyst that will propel Rocket to a higher valuation and amazing company. (Spoiler: No short squeeze discussion here, there are other DD's floating around for that).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSeveral risk factors and plays affecting RKT price NOW:\n\n* General market was in a downward trend - FED meeting\n* Rates got spooked and ticked up\n* Raw Material Shortage\n* Lack of housing supply in prior months\n\nNow lets look at some of the catalysts that will work in RKT's favor in the coming months:\n\n* **Spring Housing Boom**. It is known that spring and pre-summer are the most active in real-estate, and this year is no different. We should expect an uptick in movement/sales/refi/building.\n* **Biden Administration $15k first time home buyer tax credit & DACA eligibility**. This administration is kicking housing into full gear the next couple of months by offering MAJOR incentives for first time homebuyers. They are also making the 700k DACA recipients elidable for federally insured mortgages (guess where younger folks shop for stuff? Online)\n* **Housing data comes out this week**. The outlook looks positive so far (I will go over this thesis in a bit) with the release of housing data, we will get a peer into the real estate market and trend. Overall, the market is still very hot, with huge demand spikes. This will only carry over into the spring housing market boom, and will incentivize more owners to capitalize on this selling opportunity and for builders to kick things into high gear. Overall the trends look good, and in favor of RKT.\n* **The new inventory spike**. With homes selling quick, and bidding wars happening, supply will soon catch up to this demand and we should see an up-tick in home sales. Last month, severe winter storms temporarily disrupted some of the supple of homes nationally. As we move into March, we should see more movement.\n* **Interest rate uncertainty**. This is a double edge sword. If we think of the inverse, with homeowners knowing that rate increases are imminent, it will incentivize more refi's before. On the flip, what happens when rates go up? RKT adjusts their financials as well. There are many articles analyzing the affect of higher rates, and overall, it seems to have little impact on the short term demands in the coming months.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow let's try and break apart the data we have access too, to try and predict how the housing data will look next week. Let's start with the MONTHLY NEW RESIDENTITAL CONSTUCTION, FEBURARY 2021:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zf5ev4mds9o61.png?width=703&format=png&auto=webp&s=57e053936be22dc7c1344af79f7757358f612ad7\n\nWhat we can gather from this, is Feb had a down-trend in Permits/Starts/Completions. Let's dig deeper into some of the numbers from the report. When we do, we can see that the New Privately-Owner Housing Units Authorized (Basically new builds coming up), was higher this last month by +28.9% YoY and +3.9% MoM. Ape speak? More supply is on the way!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/388skcdht9o61.png?width=707&format=png&auto=webp&s=4b75bdffc2aebe76caceacc7fb36f40bc6b41bee\n\nThe report goes into more detail, I encourage everyone to take a deeper look. *The U.S. Census Bureau and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.* The outlook on supply catching up to demand is in the numbers, we should see more sales happening over the next couple of months, and see a positive upward trend.\n\nAlso a good report to look into is the [Weekly Economic and Housing Market update.](https://www.realtor.com/research/video-weekly-economic-and-housing-market-update-mar-19-2021/) They talk about most of the points referenced here, but one snippet stood out:\n\n>\"Despite higher rates, our latest Weekly Housing Trends View shows that prices are rising and homes are still selling faster. More supply is needed, and is expected as we approach spring.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnother release by First American [here](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210319005055/en/Rising-Rates-Unlikely-to-Dampen-Spring-Home-Buying-Season-According-to-First-American-Potential-Home-Sales-Model). \n\n>Rising Rates Unlikely to Dampen Spring Home-Buying Season, According to First American Potential Home Sales Model  \n>  \n>‚ÄîEven if mortgage rates continue to rise, increasing household formation, in conjunction with more favorable market conditions, will keep home-buying demand high, says Chief Economist\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs a final thought, the special dividend payment is going out this week. There is a chance of re-investments back into the stock, and valuations going up. I like the stock. I am holding this for the value.\n\nAs always, do you own due diligence before buying into any stock.

Who cares nobody is going to read it anyways.\n\nA bond is a loan. When you buy a bond from an entity, you are essentially loaning them your money.  like any loans, a bond has a face value ( principal) and coupon rate( interest you get for loaning the money until the loan matures). So when I buy a $1000 bond, let say for the face value which is $1000 and a coupon rate of 2%( a year), it means  I will get 2% of the principal which is $20 yearly and at the end of the term when it matures I get my principal back.\n\nA bond yield ( there are different ways of calculating this but for the most part you need to know yield to maturity rate)  =  annual coupon payment / bond price. so for the example above the yield is the same as coupon rate of 2%.\n\nSo reading this you might ask yourself that why the yield fluctuates. Referring back to the yield formula above, for yields to go up, either the coupon amount has to increase or the bond price needs to drop. coupon is usually fixed so the only way the yields can go up is for the bond to depreciate in price. Remember regardless of how much you pay for a $1000 bond, you will get the same coupon payment and $1000 principal at the end.\n\nImagine you are selling a car  and you have a buyer who is willing to pay $9500 and your friend asks you if you would sell the car to her and she will pay you $10000 in a year. Is this a fair deal? In order to answer this question you need to determine how much $10000 a year from now is worth today aka present value(PV) of future cash (FV). This is a fundamental concept in putting a value on an assets(long duration) like stocks or bonds. In simple terms, what you do is to look at the rates for a one year loan and let's say it is 5%.\n\nPV of $10000 = $10000 / (1+0.05) = $9523\n\nso if you wait a year you get more money for your car.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn the example above, I assumed there was no inflation ( =0). but what if the inflation is 2%?  Let's do the same PV(present value) calculation only considering inflation:\n\nPV + PV\\*Inflation = $10000 (FV) so PV = 9803.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nso now considering both rates ( interest rate + inflation):\n\nPV +PV\\*interest + PV\\*inflation = FV -> PV = FV / (1+ inflation+interest).\n\nSo going back to the car example and including inflation:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPV = 10000 / (1 + .05+ .02) = $9345.\n\nSo, with inflation,  now the 9500 offer sounds better than 10000 next year.  The higher the inflation, the lower the PV of a future cash flow.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is the main reason for the all the volatility in the past few weeks. As the inflation fears grow, people start discounting the value of 10 year treasury notes to PV and realizing that it is not worth it to pay as much as last year to buy the bonds because of the fear of erosion in the pv due to an inflation hike and are paying less to buy bonds and that causes the bond yields to go up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA similar method is used for stock valuation to determine the PV of future cash flows of a company. in this process, an investor determines the PV of  the future earnings (cash flow) of a company and based on that calculates a fair price. So for the growth stocks where most of the cash flow is in the future, the the higher the inflation the lower the PV of those cash flows and hence you see multiples on those stocks drop.\n\nSo in high inflation environments, value stocks are preferred since a good chunk of their earnings is happening at the present especially the ones with pricing power. i.e. banks, energy, commodities and industrial.","created_utc":"2021-03-20 19:20:42","num_comments":176,"score":665,"upvote_ratio":0.92,"is_original_content":false,"permalink":"/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m9iu6u/what_do_bonds_and_yields_mean/","title":"What Do Bonds and Yields Mean?","author":"td0000001","firstseen":"2021-03-24 21:45:29.933986"}

Poshmark connects buyers with sellers, who often list items from their own closet. And it makes money by taking a cut of every transaction.\n \nPoshmark (POSH) went public on January 14, 2021, at a price of $42, but when shares opened for trading the stock reached $104.98. Since then the stock price has fallen to more reasonable prices and is currently trading at about $46. \n\nThe company owns and operates a social marketplace. This platform is used to buy and sell lifestyle products in the U.S. and Canada (and it is currently expanding to Australia). POSH sells apparel, footwear, beauty, and home products as well as accessories and jewelry. (As it expands to Australia, it is trying to enter the pets market and distribute pet supplies and accessories like Chewy)\n\nAs POSH is a social marketplace the company encourages repeat purchases ensuring a high customer engagement rate. It ended the September quarter with more than 31.7 million active users, 6.2 million active buyers, and 4.5 million active sellers.\n\nPOSH claims active users spent 27 minutes on average each day on its platform in 2019 which resulted in 20.5 billion social interactions. While the company‚Äôs sales rose 38% year over year in 2019 to $205 million, its net loss widened by 236% to $49 million.\n\nIn the first three quarters of 2020, sales were up 28% at $193 million. Further, the company was also able to turn profitable and reported $21 million in net income. For the last quarter ended Dec. 31, Poshmark's loss narrowed to $4.06 million, or 31 cents per share, from a loss of $14.75 million, or $1.20 per share, a year earlier. After adjusting for one-time items, the company earned 5 cents a share during the quarter.\n\nRevenue climbed 27% to $69.32 million from $54.74 million a year earlier. That was higher than the average revenue estimate of $68 million, reported by Refinitiv.\n\nFor the first quarter of 2021, Poshmark is calling for revenue to fall within a range of $75.5 million to $77.5 million. Analysts had been calling for $79.2 million on average.\n\nConsumers, especially younger ones, are increasingly turning to these types of internet marketplaces for secondhand goods. Sellers are starting to prefer the site as they do not have to deal with estimating shipping price. There is only USPS priority. This allows the item to reach the buyer much faster and saves the time of the seller. Items over $500 are sent to Poshmark to ship to the buyer. This is to verify authenticity. This reduces/eliminates any scams that sellers or buyers have to go through for fake item claims. Trust is essential. Convenience is key. \n\nPoshmark said its count of active buyers reached 6.5 million in the fourth quarter, up 20% year over year. The company defines active buyers as unique users who have purchased at least one item on the platform in the trailing 12 months, regardless of returns and cancellations.\n\nCowen & Co. has previously estimated that the resale market in the U.S. is valued at $30 billion to $35 billion.\n\nTL;DR After DD, I feel that the stock is undervalued.

According to sources such as S3 Partners, Ortex, Fintel, Yahoo! Finance, and a few others, most short interest estimates I have found range from 20%-80% of the float, not accounting for shorts through ETFs. This is down from estimates of about 140%-150% during the first squeeze, if this information is to be correct, it is clear that the first squeeze had numerous shorts covering, but not all shorts were covered. This leaves us with the current range of 20%-80% interest, which is still quite high.  \n&#x200b;  \nhttps://i.imgur.com/BSpHXlu.jpg  \n&#x200b;  \nNow, based on Fintel information, we can see that institutional put/call ratio is 2.81, meaning there is still a large portion of shorts compared to long positions. We can also see that for the past 10 trading days ~23% of trading volume has been short sales, which could provide support for the theory of the price being shorted so it doesn't go up too much.    \n&#x200b;  \nhttps://i.imgur.com/Mp5cJXD.jpg    \n&#x200b;  \n#TSLA Graph  \nNow, if we look at Tesla's graph from 2020 to now, we can see the process of a slow short squeeze along with catalysts and improving value for the company. (Namely Model 3 sales)     \n&#x200b;  \nTowards the beginning of 2020 Tesla short interest was estimated to be ~20%, ending now at ~5%.  \n&#x200b;  \nTesla seemed to follow a similar pattern to what we are seeing starting now, where it has a bit of a squeeze, corrects, more squeeze, corrects, rinse and repeat.     \n&#x200b;  \nhttps://i.imgur.com/KB4hKRu.jpg    \n&#x200b;  \n#Is This Similar?\nBased on the numbers available and the patterns available, it appears this could be a similar squeeze to the 2020 Tesla short squeeze. However, this scenario is also different, we are dealing with a situation with a lot more press and larger short volume, not to mention an almost war like scenario, David and Goliath style.   \n&#x200b;  \nIt is also worth noting, company catalysts fueled the Tesla squeeze, similarly we can see the recent squeeze from $40 to $200 was because of digital transformation plans, but for this to follow the same pattern catalysts would need to continue coming.  \n&#x200b;  \n#Unknowns\nNow, a few things I wanted to briefly go over while I have my little stage here. First, there's no way to tell how earnings will affect the stock, if it will. Earnings could come out surprisingly well or have good guidance, and it could be a catalyst. Shorts could use the opportunity to push the price down more, after all markets tend to react negatively to earnings, it would be a good way to hide it. It may entice some of you to sell prior to earnings and buy again at a lower price, however because of the strange nature of this stock, if you want to be here for a potential squeeze it would be better to just HODL.   \n&#x200b;  \nI would also like to note, there's no way for us to accurately see who is currently still short GME, such as if Citadel or Melvin still hold the same positions they were in before. Melvin reported they owned 60,000 puts on GME with no calls to hedge as of 12/31/2020, you can see this in their [most recent 13F filing, which was filed 2/26/21.](https://sec.report/Document/0000905718-21-000248/)  \n&#x200b;  \nIf you would like to see the most recent info on institutional ownership, take a visit to [holdings channel, which gives a good view based on the most recent information from filings.](https://www.holdingschannel.com/bystock/?symbol=gme)    \n&#x200b;     \nFrom this we can see that Citadel and Melvin are (unsurprisingly) some of the largest short positions, however Melvin has no hedging but Citadel also owns a large amount of calls, which I would assume is to hedge.      \n&#x200b;  \nThat's all I have for you apes today, thanks for reading, and I feel as though this is required;      \nNot financial advice.","created_utc":"2021-03-20 18:38:35","num_comments":215,"score":830,"upvote_ratio":0.87,"is_original_content":false,"permalink":"/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m9i1at/gme_possible_tesla_like_short_squeeze_dd/","title":"GME - Possible Tesla Like Short Squeeze? - DD","author":"LukeMedia","firstseen":"2021-03-24 21:45:29.935388"}

Well let me learn you some additional market mechanics.\n\nSay you own 100 shares of $GME at $100 and you can sell a $110 call covered call for $10.\n\nGiven that price, what's the cheapest a $100 put could be to buy? Well, it better be $10 or greater because otherwise there would be an arbitrage!\n\nSay the put cost only $9, then you could pay for the put with the $10 call, and guarantee yourself $1 per share.\n\nSo what does this mean? As call option prices are driven up by MMs, put option prices must rise similarly, and this introduces another opportunity to influence the price of the stock ***by selling puts and collecting a fat premium.***\n\nSay you sell a put. What does the MM need to do to hedge their risk? **They need to buy stock because they are now long a put to offset the negative delta in the put.** What happens as the price moves upwards? MMs will sell that stock at a slow rate since gamma will drop off slowly. What happens if the price moves downwards? MMs will need to buy the stock an accelerating pace since gamma will increase rapidly on the put.\n\n**This strategy will essentially put a floor on the price on the price of GME and you get to collect the premiums being induced by the MMs on the call side.**\n\nIt's also a way to lock in a buy at a lower if getting assigned on an option is your thing.\n\nDownsides: you're short convexity on this trade, so don't expect your account to double or triple. Then again, the MMs are trying to prevent run up, so convexity is unreasonably expensive to begin with. Additionally, it's very capital intensive (unless you hedge with long puts instead of cash security).\n\nAside: Put call parity is actually a far more complicated mechanic with American options due to early exercise, but the point still stands that puts must increase in price along with calls if MMs try to discourage gamma squeezing.\n\nImportant Edit: Take a look at puts prices sub $100. Even a $50 put out a few months has stupidly high premiums to eat up.","created_utc":"2021-03-20 16:49:59","num_comments":84,"score":69,"upvote_ratio":0.67,"is_original_content":false,"permalink":"/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m9fw78/selling_puts_how_to_profit_off_stupidly_high/","title":"Selling Puts: How to Profit Off Stupidly High Premiums with Put Call Parity","author":"YOLOQuant","firstseen":"2021-03-24 21:45:29.937684"}

{"_id":{"$oid":"605bb2f95df7eedfb49c1e54"},"id":"m9frpz","fullname":"t3_m9frpz","selftext":"Right, I‚Äôve been hearing a lot of doom and gloom regarding UWMC and a lot of techno analysis mumbo jumbo regarding technical analysis. Now, I do not know too much about technical analysis‚Ä¶ I analyze things from a fundamental perspective, and those of you who are dooming and glooming like your pants have caught fire need to stop and take a breath.\n\nI am not going to lie, and state I was not laughing when I was seeing some stuff like ‚ÄúIt might go down below 7.5,‚Äù or ‚ÄúCould it head to six or five?‚Äù Well, the tangible price to book value of UWMC is 7.65. The price-to-tangible book value ratio measures a company‚Äôs market price in relation to its tangible book value. The ratio denotes how much investors are paying for each dollar of physical assets. In short, if you liquidated everything, you would get 7.65 dollars per share. As it stands that is a tangible price to tangible book value ratio of 1.169. The CEO has already confirmed that the first quarter of 2021 is going to be gangbusters, and surpass the last quarter of Q4 2020 which was‚Ä¶ You guessed it, gangbusters. So why is everyone screaming at the top of their lungs, and acting like this bad boy is going to nosedive worse than CDProjectRed‚Äôs reputation after Cyberpunk came out? This despite the tangible book to value ratio easily, easily, going above $8 dollars a share after Q1 2021. I will try to answer that in a bit but let me go ahead and go through some other valuation metrics.\n\nA value stock refers to shares of a company that appears to trade at a lower price relative to its fundamentals, such as dividends, earnings, or sales, making it appealing to value investors. Common characteristics of value stocks include high dividend yield, low P/B ratio, and a low P/E ratio. As a generalized rule of thumb P/E ratios for value stocks are meant to sit anywhere between 11 to 15.\n\nThe 4th Quarter of 2020 was very good for UWMC as they got a net income of $1.37B and for the full year it was a net income of $3.38B. There was also a total gain margin of 305 bps in 4Q20 (3.05%) compared to 110BPS in 4Q19. It is important to note that for Q4 2020, this is pre-tax and so the net income is $1.0925 Billion. Starting from Q1 2020, it will be post tax for net income. Total assets at the close of Q4 2020 was $11,493,283 (Spread across cash and cash equivalents, mortgage loans at fair value, and mortgage servicing rights).\n\nUWMC maintained an average application to clear to close time of approximately **18** days in Q4 2020. This is while the industry average (in management‚Äôs estimate of the industry) grew to -52- days (This is due to the mortgage and refinance boom). This was 10 days higher than the nine-month average off 42 days. For the month of December, the days to close was 16 days, while management‚Äôs estimate grew to 54 days. Furthermore, the delinquency and forbearance rates are well below industry averages.\n\nEmployees grew from 4,907 on December 31, 2019 to 7,475 on December 31, 2020. This represents an increase of 52 percent in employees and is a bullish indicator of the mortgage market in 2021 and beyond. A part of this is likely because they intend to restart their jumbo offerings which are expected to go live in March 2021 and which management expects to materially increase purchase volume during the remainder of 2021. The wholesale channel, which is where UWM is #1 and which is their sole focus, continues to be viewed as the growth channel of the residential mortgage industry. It represented only 17.2% of the total mortgage market for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. Of that 17.2%, UWM had grown its market share to 34.3% for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. Finally, the non-funding debt to equity is .49 which is important for later.\n\nManagement is projecting Q1 2021 closed loan volume between $52 Billion and $57 Billion, which would represent an increase of 22.6% and 34.4% from Q1 2020. The total gain margin of 2-2.35% is an increase of 110.5%-142.1% compared to .95% in the first quarter of 2020.\n\nYes, yes, but what does that mean? Well, we know that they beat Q4 2020 EPS by a staggering 30 cents and reported a .62 Earnings Per Share. We also know that it will be even better, for Q1 2020, but that analysts are expecting .40 for this quarter, and a FY of 1.27 EPS (which is ludicrously low). So, let us look at the future P/E ratio in a normal scenario, and in an analyst scenario (analyst scenario being the worst-case scenario). For the normal scenario we use Q4 2020 EPS so .62\\*4= 2.48 in earnings per share for the FY EPS (I am projecting higher Q1 and Q2 revenues, to account for the slowdown in winter). This would make for a future P/E ratio in 2021 of 3.608 if the price stuck to 8.95. A P/E ratio of 11 would mean that the stock would hold a price of 27.28. Let us look at the analyst average now. A current P/E ratio of 7.04 to the current price point of 8.95 would apply **right now** if the consensus analyst average were met. For a P/E ratio of 11 the price point of UWM would have to be 15.62. Alright. Undervalued. Gotcha. But let us see if it meets the other metrics. Even after Rocket‚Äôs massive sell off, the price to earnings ratio for Rocket is 13.56, and they hold a market cap of 49.55B. Please remember that the tangible book value of UWMC is over $11 Billion, and as such that is over 20 percent of the market cap of RKT which is a diversified company but also is in the Wholesale Mortgage Market and holds the title of 2nd largest wholesale mortgager while also having a private broker channel with higher margin.\n\nAt .40 in dividends per year, the yield at $8 is 5%, and at $9 it is 4%. This is deep value, as the stock made a profit margin of $3.38 Billion. As the market cap of the company is currently sitting at 13.4 Billion‚Ä¶ This represents a profit margin to market cap of 23.5% rounded up. The tangible book to value ratio also means that the company could conceivably pay the current dividend with no profits for over a decade. As such, the dividend yield is safe and is in fact due for a raise. Q1 2021 is expected to be quite profitable as well, and I expect management to beat their projections, but we will discuss why later. It is also important to note that the balance sheet is a fortress to weather downturns.\n\nBut, HB, that is not what we are scared about. We are scared about 2023, and 2024! Well, before I begin, let me make one thing clear. The mortgage market is here to stay, and it will be continuously growing. The only question is at what rate. I seriously hope you are not betting against the mortgage market, because the only thing that will kill it is WWIII, or depopulation. However, I will entertain your doom and gloom fanfiction because I am nice like that. There are currently around 75 mortgage companies operating in the United States in a highly fragmented market. UWMC engages mostly in the provisioning of home purchases, while Rocket is more geared toward refinancing. Let us get one thing out of the way first, before I continue. The notion that refinancing was all pushed forward and that the mortgage industry just had its income all front loaded is absurd. Before Covid the Federal Reserve was hiking rates up, and it is only because of Covid and the Fed‚Äôs resultant dovish policy that the interest rates crashed below 3 percent for the first time ever. Rates would have otherwise gone up. This has helped mortgage companies because they conducted refinances that would have otherwise never occurred. Furthermore, at least in earlier quarters, the interest rate was effectively above 3% because of the sheer demand which allowed companies to charge above a 3% rate. Furthermore, WFH has allowed home prices to increase across the spectrum from rural homes to exurban and suburban homes due to increased demand. In the case of a mass market crash, UWM‚Äôs dominant position in the wholesale mortgage industry will allow it to gobble up market share from struggling other mortgagers, while it is fortress of a balance sheet will allow it to reduce profit margin to be more competitive and effectively aid itself in squeezing out competitors. Finally, it can just flat out weather the storm due to its balance sheet, while keeping its dividend. This will happen regardless, but a crash would accelerate this.\n\nNow, for the more likely scenario. Demand is booming, but inventory is scarce, and it takes time for supply to be made to meet demand. Let us look at the current demand, however. To look at this, we need to look at the stock of home builders. Therefore, let us look at Lennar. Lennar‚Äôs quarterly earnings per share were up 60.63% over the past year to 2.04 which beat the estimate of $1.71. It has a P/E ratio of 9.67 however, and a fair market value that would have it a little above that. More generally, the estimate is that it will take 5 years for home builders to get inventory equivalent to demand as homebuilding takes time. What does that mean exactly? A metric fuck ton of buyers, but only so many homes. In that sense, perhaps interest rates are not the boogie man that people think they are. Why? Well, I‚Äôll put supply and demand in banana speak‚Ä¶ Just for you. You are all apes, and you live in trees, but you need to buy the tree you sleep in with banana‚Äôs. The trees cost too much for you, so you need to take out a mortgage to buy the tree with your bananas. However, the bananas per month expected of you is rising because of higher interest rates that those pesky humans are demanding. So, less apes want to buy trees, and as a result, the price to buy a tree drops to meet demand until demand equals supply‚Ä¶ Except supply is so low that demand will always beat supply even with higher interest rates!\n\nTo account for all this lack of homes, people are deciding to do cash out refinances in 2021 as a means of getting cash out of their home so that they can upgrade their starter homes to fit their growing families. Furthermore, sales of new homes were up 19% on an annual basis according to a MarketWatch Economic Report on February 24, 2021 even though the cost of new homes were rising due to increased lumber costs. That was a stunning 4.3% above the already upwardly revised pace of 885,000 in December. Furthermore, inventory dropped slightly to a four-month supply. A six-month supply of homes is generally considered indicative of a balanced market. What does that mean? Simple, demand outstrips supply for newly built homes. Hard. Finally, millennials are in their peak home buying years. Finally, a new survey from Zillow found that 70% of homeowners said they would feel comfortable moving to a new home if there were widespread vaccine distribution, compared with just 52% who feel that way as things stand now. What that means, is that demand is expected to increase as Covid 19 moves further and further into our rear-view mirror. It has gotten to the point where there are affordability concerns. Demand has gone so off the charts that a record 26.4% of new homes on the market do not even exist yet. Of the 307,000 homes that were on the market at the end of January, just 42,000 of them had been completed. At 13.7% that was the lowest on record.\n\nI will briefly address the ultimatum Ishbka made. It is smart, and while it might cap the ceiling a bit, it substantially raises the floor and protects the wholesale market. There will still be growth in market share. He is basically doing a solid for his clientele because he does not want what Zillow did to real estates to happen to his customers. It will also stunt top line growth for Fairway and Rocket.  Furthermore, the Rocket 8-K for more financing, is also a bullish catalyst for UWMC.\n\nSo, let us look at some positive catalysts for UWMC:\n\n¬∑ Infrastructure Package to bring more growth, and perhaps even increase productivity. It is a more general positive catalyst, but it is good for UWMC as well.\n\n¬∑ Minimum Wage increase. Whether it be Mitt Romney who wants 10-10.5 and indexed to inflation, or Bernie Sanders 15-dollar minimum wage.\n\n¬∑ Jim Cramer‚Äôs interview with the CEO of UWMC.\n\n¬∑ The Q1 Earnings Call and 8Q. I expect a dividend raise, a share buyback, a special dividend, or a combination of all three.\n\n¬∑ HUD‚Äôs confirmation of Marcia Fudge as HUD Secretary who is focused on racial equity because minorities (Especially latino‚Äôs and African American‚Äôs) lag far behind white American‚Äôs in home ownership. Fudge has stated in her press interview on March 18th that there is an immediate housing concern in the increasing price of home ownership. The average price of homes is higher in her words, and the ‚Äúinventory is much less‚Äù than hoped. A major problem she noted, is that ‚ÄúCredit is not available and accessible for people who do actually qualify.‚Äù She stated that since FHA is in her purview, they would work with issues of ‚Äúrestructuring,‚Äù ‚Äúaccess to credit,‚Äù and the ‚Äúdown payment‚Äù as part of the solution for this solution. Finally, she stated that she was going to make sure people who qualify have access to credit, and she shares the same vision as President Biden to include in this plan policies aimed at closing the racial wealth gap. As UWMC handles FHA loans, this is a boon to them.\n\n¬∑ Meeting the growth targets in 2021 and coming back to full employment by the end of 2021.\n\n¬∑ I will mention interest rates, but I do not think it really matters as demand is so over supply that it has stopped mattering. It is also very important to note that rates remain very low by historical standards, and even though they have trended up their still well below pre-pandemic levels. The average interest rate on a new 30-year mortgage loan was above 3.50% in Jan 2020, and those who obtained loans to buy home sin 2019 or prior likely had loan rates close to or even above 4%. Meanwhile refinance rates always tend to be a little higher than rates for new home loans are hovering in the low 3% range.\n\n¬∑ Continuing demand in 2021, and onward.\n\nSo, what does this mean? Well, let us look at where I am right now. I hold 200 shares at 8.66, and 7 options contracts. UWMC $9 Calls for 4.16 with a breakeven at $10.39, and $7.5 Calls for 5/21 for a break-even price of 10.15. I intend to purchase more shares if it climbs lower, and even purchase more options to average down my cost basis in them (I didn‚Äôt buy them at the top, or at the bottom). I will likely roll my April calls to May closer to the expiration date, and I will very likely exercise these shares if they are between the strike price and the premium. I may just exercise them period, so that I can go on to sell covered calls at a price point above what I bought them at. Likely $11-14. This would decrease my cost basis. To exercise these options would cost me 6,000, which I am alright with doing. I also have almost $1,800 in shares, and I intend to raise my share count in this manner. 1) Buy tentatively at 8.95, 2) buy moderately at $8.50, 3) Buy aggressively at $8 and below, and 4) Should It legitimately go below 8 dollars. I may legitimately start liquidating most of my other assets except AMD and a few other select holdings to purchase a massive number of shares in UWMC. Then, I intend to sell covered calls at a share price I would be comfortable selling at, but I do not believe will be met with the strike plus premium and will therefore not be called. The dollar value of my shares should likely reach 2500 on Monday, unless the drop is precipitous, in which case it may rise to 5,000. If it reaches 8 dollars, I will raise it to 10,000. If it goes below the current tangible book value of 7.65, I will likely have an aneurysm at the idiocy, but I will raise my stake to my entire portfolio, excluding my 110 shares of AMD. This will likely be around $24,000 dollars, including my exercised options as my portfolio ranges from $31,000 to $32,000 at current.\n\nAt the end of the day, I am not in the market to lose money or gamble, but to make it. 25,000 at a five percent dividend yield is 1,250. And I expect the dividend to be raised more and more. The company has a fortress of a balance sheet, competitive and technological advantages over its competitors, and the largest market share in a highly fragmented field where it can take even more. It is also increasing its profit margin YoY. I do like Rocket too, and that is why I have 50 shares in it, but its P/E ratio is far above UWMC‚Äôs and is equivalent to a value stock. While I do think it is going to go higher, I think that UWMC is the correct play at current.\n\nIf a 7-10 percent increase in the share price due to Russel inclusion where the share price would have increased 62 cents to 89 cents is the metric which you would have bought and held this company, then you are a swing trader and while it is unfortunate it is ultimately small potatoes. I would heavily, heavily, urge you to reconsider selling because the potential upside is much higher than the downside. The stock going below 8 means that the price to book value in May will be less than 1, and by a not insignificant degree. Patience.\n\nThis has honestly been such a long write up I‚Äôm not even going into the Total Fertility Rate for generational population growth (and thus demand/inventory over the next 1-3 generations), because I think this is enough.\n\nI do expect, despite this report I‚Äôve compiled, that there will be a significant amount of paper handling, and I‚Äôm okay with that because I believe in the fundamentals of this company and I can wait. Lowering cost averages is what I do. I expect a runup in late April to earnings, and some juicy announcements come Q1 2020 Earnings. I‚Äôll also tune in to Jim Cramer‚Äôs interview with the CEO when it happens.\n\nThanks for reading. I shall go ahead and state that this is not financial advice, but the thought process that I am going through with this on a forward moving basis. I have some thoughts on GE, and was compiling a report for that too, but I‚Äôll shelve it in favor of this for now. GE isn‚Äôt going anywhere.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOkay fine TLDR: UWMC is a steal, even with higher interest rates.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSome References:\n\n[New home sales rise as buyers remain hamstrung by the lack of property listings - MarketWatch](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/new-home-sales-rise-as-buyers-remain-hamstrung-by-the-lack-of-property-listings-11614180009)\n\n[26.4%: How builders are coping with low inventories - MarketWatch](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/builders-are-selling-lots-of-houses-that-havent-been-built-yet-11614195857)\n\n[New home sales rise slightly, even as buyers see more affordability contraints - MarketWatch](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/new-home-sales-rise-slightly-even-as-buyers-see-more-affordability-contraints-11611847410)\n\n[It‚Äôs time buy these home builder stocks as part of the millennial-driven housing boom, analyst says - MarketWatch](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/its-time-buy-these-home-builder-stocks-as-part-of-the-millennial-driven-housing-boom-analyst-says-11605881301)\n\n[Mortgage Rates Are Rising.

{"_id":{"$oid":"605bb2f95df7eedfb49c1e56"},"id":"m9fq7w","fullname":"t3_m9fq7w","selftext":"Hi all! I made post yesterday about the bullish/bearish trends that GME exhibited in the past 4 months. I wanted to make a follow up post and share some pretty shapes I found in the charts with a few indicators to support the patterns.  üåàüêª  thesis included.\n\nFirst, here is where we are with some lines drawn in:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2m0xkmipu8o61.png?width=484&format=png&auto=webp&s=3cdb729fb4541e134f9605ee40be674451ac3441\n\nSecond, according to Investopedia, there are a few conditions for a real cup with handle chart pattern:\n\n1. **Trend:** To qualify as a continuation pattern, a prior trend should exist. Ideally, the trend should be a few months old and not too mature. **Check**\n2. **Cup:** The cup should be ‚ÄúU‚Äù shaped and resemble a bowl or rounding bottom. A ‚ÄúV‚Äù shaped bottom would be considered too sharp of a reversal to qualify. **Check**\n3. **Cup Depth:** Ideally, the depth of the cup should retrace 1/3 or less of the previous advance. However, with volatile markets and over-reactions, the retracement could range from 1/3 to ¬Ω. **Kinda check?** We fell from 483 to around 38 so this was a very abnormal retracement, and so we need to be a little weary.\n4. **Handle:** After the high forms on the right side of the cup, there is a pullback that forms the handle. Sometimes this handle resembles a flag or pennant that slopes downward, other times it is just a short pullback. The handle represents the final consolidation/pullback before the big breakout and can retrace up to 1/3 of the cup's advance, but usually not more. The smaller the retracement, the more bullish the formation and significant the breakout. **Kinda check again?** We fell from around 340 to 173, at one point. However, if only opening and closing prices ranges are factored, it would be 275 to 201. This is only a 27% drop and a 33% drop would be 183.15.\n5. **Duration:** The cup can extend from 1 to 6 months, sometimes longer on weekly charts. The handle can be from 1 week to many weeks and ideally completes within 1-4 weeks. **Almost there**\n6. **Volume:** There should be a substantial increase in volume on the breakout above the handle's resistance. **Maybe one day?**\n\nOkay now let‚Äôs look at just the handle:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ru5bg80yu8o61.png?width=489&format=png&auto=webp&s=16083754a6dbdef77db377f2eadac0e28b7f68ea\n\nSo we can clearly see downward trend lines with a support line hovering around 180ish here. It is also backed with decreased MACD momentum, slight overselling (W%R trending down), and signs of a DMI convergence (evidence of bearish sentiment). We will need to see if a downward triangle forms in the coming weeks. If one forms, then that further confirms bearish sentiment.\n\nLooking back at our handle rules, we can see that a handle must be formed in 1-4 weeks, and it looks like the handle formation began 6 trading days ago.\n\nKnowing that our bear trends for GME usually last 6-14 days, the timing lines up perfectly for proper handle formation.\n\nThe only thing left is to wait out the handle and get a solid breakout with huge volume. Then GME go boom boom.\n\nEvidence of cup with handle pattern: two high resistances with a low ‚ÄúU‚Äù shaped support in the middle. Formation of 1-4 weeks of price stagnation with a downward trendlines. Handle supported by W%R, DMI, and MACD.\n\nPotential reasons cup with handle might fail: Price fell too low out of expected range during ‚ÄúU‚Äù formation. Potentially, price might fall too low during handle formation, and most importantly there needs to be large volume to breakout of the handle. Also, there may be a sub pattern forming as an inverse cup from 3/16-3/19. I have not analyzed it much yet, but it was pointed out to me by another redditor.\n\nEdit: Added one more potential reasons cup with handle might fail.\n\nEdit2: Removed links.\n\nEdit3: My bad yall! As pointed out in comments, not descending triangle as that is a continuation pattern not a reversal pattern. Changing it to say \"downward trendlines\" instead, cant change the title unfortunately LOL what can i say im retarded\n\nObligatory emojis: üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ\n\nTY FOR THE AWARDS!

Some have made us millions; some have destroyed portfolios. But I just CAN‚ÄôT resist hammering out this DD. Maybe I was born with bear blood.\n\nI present to you my thesis as to why the market is looking vulnerable to a correction in the next months, and why the new challenger‚Äîbonds‚Äîpresents a significant downside risk.\n\n\\--\n\n**Exhibit A: Enormous market inflow of new, paper-handed money**\n\nLast week we saw a record $56.8 billion flow into equities. That amount is staggering, and much of it is no doubt due to the Biden Bucks landing in bank accounts. That new money to the market with terrible cost basis is weakly positioned and notoriously paper-handed.\n\n**Exhibit B: A new challenger enters the ring: Bonds.**\n\nI can hear you retards whining about it now. ‚ÄúBut I don‚Äôt give a shit about bonds, why are they even relevant?‚Äù Yes, these are your grandparents‚Äô bonds. They also make up a significant portion of 401ks, pensions, and endowments. This is BIG money. These funds go through a quarterly rebalancing where they sell-off what is high and buy what is low. I expect a massive amount of profit-taking in tech and overvalued industrials as those funds seek to lower risk, rebalance, and take advantage of the juicy higher yields.\n\n**Exhibit C: We are again at historic P/E multiples**\n\nBack in the old days, the value of a company was a factor of its earnings and future earnings potential over the next several years. It‚Äôs no secret that stocks have completely left regard for fundamentals long ago and are instead priced as speculative instruments. Take TSLA for example. To make its valuation make sense they would need to have a 100% market share. Maybe they will be selling forty-thousand-dollar cars to millions of kids in Africa next year, and I just missed that at the shareholder meeting.\n\nCurrent P/E rates on the S&P are touching 40 on average. In 2000 we briefly touched 44.\n\n**Exhibit D: The bond market likes to get cute and crash stock markets.**\n\nMany crashes have been proceeded by a rapid rise in bond yields. Now, I hear what you‚Äôre saying, JPOW announced the FED won‚Äôt let them get too rowdy. I absolutely do believe that, and I don‚Äôt think we are going to see another black Monday when an overvalued equities market was met with a sudden spike in bond yields. Again in 2018, we saw another decent correction driven by an increase in bond yields.\n\nNow, I‚Äôm not fighting the FED on this one. I do however think we are overripe for a juicy correction, and this is the perfect catalyst to set it off. As we get into 2-2.5% yields on the 10-year-note, quite possibly in the next month or so, we are going to see some money moving. There‚Äôs just no way around that, and we already see it happening with the high-flying tech and the QQQs. A lot of that money found shelter in value stocks, which are now rising parabolically like growth stocks. You can see where I‚Äôm going here.\n\n**My play:**\n\nAs I‚Äôve been burned trying to time these things in the past, I‚Äôm loaded up on longer-dated puts on SPY and QQQ. If we see a parabolic spike in SPY this week (as we did with ALL the corrections on the run-up this past year) I‚Äôll look to be adding to these positions. Also keeping plenty of dry powder for buying opportunities when the correction ensues.\n\nPositions:\n\nQQQ 5/21 270P\n\nSPY 5/21 380P\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Added puts on FB, CCL, AAL, GM, GPRO today","created_utc":"2021-03-20 16:17:05","num_comments":100,"score":274,"upvote_ratio":0.92,"is_original_content":false,"permalink":"/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m9f8zz/siren_song_of_the_marketpocalypse/","title":"Siren Song of the Marketpocalypse","author":"SpaceToaster","firstseen":"2021-03-24 21:45:29.941477"}

They sell cigs (Newport, Camel). They sell vapes (Vuse, Glo, Velo) . They sell snuff (Grizz). The business model is extremely simple and has been a cash cow in the traditional tobacco market. Still beaten down as investors shift away from cancer in a stick and move to 50x price / sales companies. As investors start to worry about inflation and shifting to value, you're looking at value stock #1.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**FUNDAMENTALS:**\n\nNot going to spend a ton of time here as everyone knows tobacco stocks are cheap and i know all you lads don't really care about them. (also these are multiples from Friday 3/12).\n\nEV / FWD EBITDA: 8.4\n\nPrice / Forward Cash Flow: 6.8\n\nPrice / Book: 1.0\n\nDividend Yield: 8.0%\n\n$BTI is legitimately is 10 - 20x cheaper than all these tech darlings which is understandable, but maintaining this business model is simple. CAPEX is minimal and they maintain complete pricing power. Okay, well all this is obvious, so why should $BTI move up? Enter Altria (**$MO**).\n\n**THESIS:**\n\n* **My main thesis is that the move up in tobacco has already started.** $MO is showing strength for the first time in years. Go search for $MO on twitter and you'll find a bunch of **stick-men (technical analysis)** analysis like this:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8rmw9ttxd8o61.png?width=1186&format=png&auto=webp&s=d50d47e6c81b34313f26742a97777d914d2721e0\n\nI have a piece of the $MO run-up  (not to brag), but am shifting those tendies to the better value, $BTI. I still like $MO a lot and think that the confluence of stick-men, your divvy crew, and overall lack of \"cheap\" stocks are contributing to the run up of tobacco. Now that the runway is clear, other tobacco stocks should follow ($IMBBY,  $PM are comparable if you're looking for other industry plays).\n\n(Side note: the $MO play is straight out of the Michael Burry playbook, and may his soul rest easy after selling both $GME And $MO early. I bet his soul is resting easier after his $C calls are most likely waaaay in the money. if you are a frequent visitor, Michael, please feel free in joining me in $BTI so that you may relieve the pain of selling $MO too early).\n\nBack to your regular programming. When you stack the performance of $MO vs. $BTI when the pandemic started, you get:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ab0o4l8e78o61.png?width=1084&format=png&auto=webp&s=a1041280bb39f87b988c05ec5a91a6359e1b144e\n\n$BTI clearly lagging after trading in tandem for a few months. This divergence has dramatically increased over the past month. Now you may say that $MO deserves to trade higher and that it must be related to performance, right? Nawww, **$BTI has outperformed $MO on a per share fundamental basis the past few years, yet still trades cheaper.** The pure strength of their combustable market is incredible. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bv9m37e0e8o61.png?width=874&format=png&auto=webp&s=78dc47910d38d8c6d9ecdf827adbb8534730038a\n\nSeems like these should could trade closer in price, no? I have a theory or two in the risk/other section, so go check that out. Anyway, I think **\\*both\\*** trade higher and lift each other. Tying this all together: **My thesis is that I'm expecting $BTI to follow the $MO move and break out of its choppy zone. You'll then start to see the divvy crew and stickmen start to post about how they're adding for income or that they \"trade the chart and not the stock\".** I'll feel rekt about this if $MO reverses, so if you've gotten to this point and hate the idea, the opposite side of this whole thesis is to buy puts on a $MO reversal.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**OTHER TAILWINDS:**\n\n* **Fears of inflation?** **(Skip this bullet if you don't like economics)** You're looking at one of the most demand inelastic products on the market. People have bought tobacco and will continue to buy tobacco for years to come. There is no better place to look at this moat than with Australia (where a pack of cigs is 5x more expensive compared to the U.S.). In the past 10 years tobacco prices have doubled, yet demand has decreased by 20-ish percent. They have complete pricing power, or an economists wet dream. I'm not here to FUD you to death about how inflation is going to wreck the economy, but price increases are already here. Go look at any relevant commodity/house price/vapor ware chart and you'll see inflation baked in. $BTI has complete pricing power.\n\n[Prevalence of Regular Smokers in Australia 18+](https://preview.redd.it/6x1z6x6ta8o61.png?width=2092&format=png&auto=webp&s=77fc0d9ef09192b44995d2424adc492cba359a81)\n\n[Time needed in minutes to buy 20 cigarettes](https://preview.redd.it/ic1w1ce7b8o61.png?width=1770&format=png&auto=webp&s=6b4fca9b6f0e90dc60c0ba75d904a4b9b387b090)\n\n* **Growth exists for vapes**, and seem a bit undervalued after the JUUL disaster a few year ago. BTI is looking to triple their vape segment to $5B by 2025. If this was a pure tech company you could throw on a 50B market cap by that volume/percent growth alone (i know this is not comparable, but I will still keep harping on it)\n\n[Investor Day Slide](https://preview.redd.it/s7ix4hjrg8o61.png?width=1630&format=png&auto=webp&s=2ef936c704e70e093ebac06b8edc8d610c714f87)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Ride the cannabis wave.** $BTI recently bought 20% of Canadian cannabis/CBD company Organigram $OGI. Would have loved to see this in 2018/2019 during the true downturn in weeeed, but these acquisitions are positive imo. A low key benefit to acquisitions in the space is that they can strike out a few times without crippling the business. Must be nice to have billions of dollars of free cash flow with small relative CAPEX [https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/21/03/20123796/bat-invests-175-7m-in-organigram-to-work-on-next-gen-cbd-products](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/21/03/20123796/bat-invests-175-7m-in-organigram-to-work-on-next-gen-cbd-products)\n* **They are literally making a covid/flu vaccine and the irony here is next level.** You can't think of a better way to ~~create more nicotine addicted customers than injecting it straight into their veins~~ change the narrative about tobacco as an ESG plant. I guess there is a real precedent here as they've successfully used this tech for ebola. Anyway, not sure how this plays out in the long-term, but it seems like a net plus. Currently in phase I trials, I imagine successful results headline could give the price a bump. No idea when they'll announce results, but phase I trials started in December.

The price on these bad boys are simply too cheap. I currently have been easing into calls with dates and strikes: **4/16 40, 6/18 40 and 45.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**RISKS/OTHER:**\n\nI will tell you though, that even though i may lie on the spectrum, I'm not blind. So that you don't obliterate me into being completely biased, I have a few reasons why **$MO** has outperformed and other general comments:\n\n* Respective Index performance: The **U.S. indices have massively outperforming the U.K market** and their stock prices are moving more in line with the index.\n* **$MO has investments in beer/liquor from Anheuser Busch.** Some armchair analysts think they should sell that position as they are eligible to sell later this year. \n* **Both have shitty balance sheets** packed with oodles of goodwill from all their acquisitions over the years. $BTI has a worse debt load (Reynolds acquisition) compared to $MO so their capital allocation is less flexible (also why they earn more?). This has allowed $MO to start investing in share buybacks.\n* **You're buying cancer in a stick**. I'm completely aware that large institutions and many individuals won't even look at tobacco as it's the polar opposite to any ESG play. **My mega brain** tells me that this is contradictory to many investing in any ESG plays that actually guzzle oil to operate, literally any fast food/sugar company, or most tech stocks that are melting/stealing (privacy crew, wya?) our brains. **My galaxy brain** tells me that investing in humans is the most non-ESG idea possible, so let's countertrade humans by investing in products that kill humans (was that too dark? definitely went a little dark there).\n* There is **beef (lawsuits) between $BTI, $PM and $MO**. $BTI is currently suing the two for patent infringement on some of their vapes. I'm not even going to pretend like this is good or bad news for the company given the length of these timelines and unpredictability of outcomes. There is an $HCMC suit that also files against $PM, but any predicted outcome feels like pure speculation. Someone smarter than me can tell you why this case is positive/negative\n* **EX-DIV is next week** at $0.75 per share. The price will trade down post recording. This is always a chicken or the egg argument, so I won't bias you in either direction. Bulls will tell you that the stock price will trade up before as investors buy in before to get the dividend, while bears will tell you owners will dump after the dividend is recorded. No opinion here, but something to be aware of.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Summary, TL;DR:**\n\n**You're buying a company that offers a highly addictive product with complete pricing power and free cash flow to the moon. The industry outperforms in inflationary or recessionary environments. Investments in alternative products (vapes, CBD, vaccines) are all niceties and should help the business grow, while the cash cow of tobacco remains king.**\n\n**Their main competitor, $MO  (sitting on a 52-week high) has cleared the runway for $BTI to make a similar move as the stick-men and income investors look for yield in an increasingly expensive market. The implied volatility on these calls are cheap (IV at 20).**\n\n**BS pRiCe TaRgEtS: 1 $MO ($50.55) = 1 $BTI (Currently, $39.27). I'll let the stickmen tell you where it can actually pop to, but I believe these are fundamentally the same company on a per share basis.**\n\n**Positions:**\n\nHigher Risk: **4/16 40C, 6/18 45C**\n\nLower Risk: **6/18 40C**\n\n**Cheers lads. Decent that, but I'm knackered and going to have a few bevvy's to wind down.**","created_utc":"2021-03-20 15:54:26","num_comments":41,"score":71,"upvote_ratio":0.73,"is_original_content":false,"permalink":"/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m9esir/british_american_tobacco_btibatsl_riding_the/","title":"British American Tobacco ($BTI/BATS.L) - Riding the Altria ($MO) Momentum","author":"plz-be-nice-to-me","firstseen":"2021-03-24 21:45:29.941839"}

{"_id":{"$oid":"605bb2f95df7eedfb49c1e60"},"id":"m9drpf","fullname":"t3_m9drpf","selftext":"So this isn't a new tactic by a long shot, and this has been around for ages, but it's time we talked about something that corporations and especially boards of directors and large fund managers use when shuffling corporate wealth and influence around during periods of restructuring.\n\nThe majority shareholders absolutely want the value of $AMC to go down. Why? They need to buy A WHOLE LOT OF IT.\n\nOf course they know issuing more will devalue the shares significantly, but only for a very short period of time.\n\nWelcome to a second type of short , the inside short. In order for a company to shore up it's own valuation, it will issue large amounts of it's own shares in order to lower it's own price per share. They will immediately snap these up in bulk to hold as much of the stake in the company as possible.\n\nHere comes the fucky part... Ready? When they have these majority cheap shares, and the market is flooded with shares under value, they wait for the company to enter a period of stable growth and profit. There's two things that happen here, there will be FUD, which leads to selloff, and there will be just plain more shares. They will snap up as much of these stocks as possible until things are normal again. This is called a Stock Buyback. That's when they issue what's called a stock reverse split.\n\nThe stock reverse split suddenly takes their 200 Million shares and turns it back into a reasonable 20 or even 5 million shares. The value stays the same, but the cost of owning just one share just became a little more difficult to pony up to. This means they maintain their status as majority shareholders, but they also cannot be taken out by a outside investor who is soaking up penny shares on the outside market. Consider that right now, you have a weighted vote in AMC. Now consider how much less of a influence your vote carries when your share count goes from 200 to just 50, or even 5. Sure it's worth the same amount of money, but it doesn't carry the same weight in the company. 200 Votes isn't the same as 5 votes. They've marginalized low end shareholders and shored their positions.\n\nThis is how companies control board room decisions and how they ensure that control over corporate direction is firmly in the hands of the people they decide they want it to be. You can't trickle your way into a deciding factor in a major shareholder vote. You are either in the money, or you're left out in the rain.\n\nEdit:\n\nEveryone should remember that a LONG position on this stock may be the best position to take on this. It's not that the stock is doomed, but the MOASS is probably doomed for sure.\n\nAMC saw what happened to GME. They are not in a position to accept becoming the next volatility stock. They're literally opening their doors this weekend. They are not in a position to become a meme when they are about to stabilize their business for the first time after a complete year of lockdowns and shutdown businesses.\n\nThanks for the Silver. This was my DD. Thanks for coming to my TED Talk: Note. None of this is financial advice. Almost all of us, including me are literally cats.\n\nEdit 2 :\n\nSo lets talk volume. This is what becomes the most important. I THINK this is what most people fail to grasp. You own 5000 shares out of 1 million, but 10 million come up tomorrow. You are now swimming in a much larger sea. Previously, you were, perhaps a middling to un-fuck-withable predator. Now the sea or lake as you would prefer has gotten much bigger. MUCH MUCH bigger. You are now much much smaller. In order to maintain your size, you must consume a lot more shares and, even though they come cheap, it will cost you that much more money to get back to your previous position. Now you need to own 500k shares JUST to be back to where you started. Growing bigger got much more expensive, and it gets more expensive as the company continues to do well. The longer you wait to get into the pool, the more it costs you.\n\nThis is why they issue more shares and eventually why they drain the pool when they are satisfied with what is available.  \n\n\nEdit 3 :  \n\n\nSo some of you have talked about a share count or what is considered a round robin. THAT WOULD BE GLORIOUS. I would probably be set to make a untold massive amount of money since the MOASS would almost trigger immediately. All things considered, either scenario I feel will be positive. AMC will not lose major value and the MOASS will not be a disaster for their volatility. They want to own their position, it's not really about saving the hedgies, it's about stability. As I've said to another poster, the problem isn't the way up, it's the way down. The down can land anywhere and they don't want to play the game on where it ends up. Right now they are on stable ground with stock and reopening. Meme stocking them right at this moment would be a disaster for their company when they are on opening week+(end)","created_utc":"2021-03-20 15:04:37","num_comments":175,"score":59,"upvote_ratio":0.58,"is_original_content":false,"permalink":"/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m9drpf/the_amc_stock_vote_will_be_a_resounding_yes_on/","title":"The AMC Stock vote will be a resounding YES on the part of the Majority, and how it affects you.

For prescription medicine, Hims & Hers employs hundreds of specialized doctors, which can prescribe medicine through call, text, or video chat. Hims & Hers offers a wide variety of products which continues to expand, such as:\n\n\n* Skin Care\n* Hair Loss and Care\n* Sex products (ED, PE, Contraception)\n* Covid Tests \n* Supplements\n* Primary Care\n* Mental Care\n\n\n**Financials -** \n\n\n* Financially stable - over 90 Million in cash + short term investments, with 0 short/long term debt\n* Gross Margin of  77% last Quarter, 74% for 2020 (54% in 2019)\n* 2.6B Market Cap\n* Negative (but improving) Cash Flow\n* Q4 EPS  of -.07 (Beat by .09)\n* Revenue of $148.8 MM for 2020, 80% yoy growth\n* 2020 Q4 Revenue of $41.5 MM (Beat by $4.47 MM)\n* Q1 2021 Revenue expects $48 - $50 MM\n* $195 - $205 MM overall 2021 Revenue estimate\n* Over 3 Million consultations \n* 91% Recurring Revenue\n\n\nSimply put, Hims & Hers has consistent, growing revenue and gross margin growth, with the main problems being in the Cash Flow and Earnings per Share. However, both are improving significantly over time.\n\n**Growth -**\n\n\nHims & Hers has many avenues to expand in, in every single part of their company. Because of how 91% of revenue is recurring, Hims & Hers is free to take many risks in expanding, as revenue will not be negatively affected as long as the subscription models are sustained. \n\n\n[Potential Medical Product Growth](https://imgur.com/a/S3lWXmr)\n\nHims & Hers' Revenue numbers are also almost only Sexual Health and Hair/Skin Care for now, as their recent additions of Primary and Mental Care have not gotten adoption yet. In Q2 of 2020 92% of Revenue was from Skin and Hair Care, as mainly recurring revenue. Once adoption of Hims & Hers Primary and Mental Care picks up, I can see the company's revenue increasing greatly, and the ecosystem created through Hims & Hers' other products will strengthen this growth.\n\n\n\n[2020 Q2 Revenue %](https://imgur.com/a/WtX16oq)\n\n\n\nThe structure of Hims & Hers also a large reason Hims & Hers has grown so much in only two years, and why the company can continue to grow. Almost every single part of the Hims & Hers experience is proprietary and created in-house, as there were no outside options at the time. However, as these structure growths have already been completed, this means that these next few years are when they will be refined, increasing gross margins, cutting out unnecessary expenses, and allowing the company to escape the bloat of the American Healthcare system caused by individual medicine companies.  \n[Hims & Hers structure](https://imgur.com/a/rjw0v0o)\n\n\n[Sources](https://investors.forhims.com/why-invest/default.aspx)\n\n\n\nAlthough Healthcare is already a Four Trillion Dollar industry, I believe that Hims & Hers has an opportunity to grow the industry as well. Many people across America simply do not receive the healthcare they need, whether due to costs, waiting time, distance, or other reasons, and Hims & Hers solves all of those problems. With appointments being online anyone across America and get diagnosed and receive a prescription within minutes, without needing to live near a hospital, and at a low cost.\n\n\n**Competitors + Why Hims & Hers?**\n\n\nI would say that Hims & Hers has a lot of overall competitors, but not for its niche and for many different reasons.\nThe biggest overall competitor would be $TDOC. As they are both in the Telehealth industry, they will inevitably clash, and of the two $TDOC is much larger. However, Hims & Hers offers direct sales of a large variety of medicine and health care products, which $TDOC does not. Because of this, I believe Hims & Hers will have a larger overall ecosystem in product offered, as well as capture the niche market requiring Skin Care, Hair Loss and Care, and Sex products, which $TDOC does not focus on. I also see Hims & Hers as having a much larger favorability with younger generations, particularly millennials and under, due to a few reasons:\n\n\n* Branding- $HIMS is heavier on advertising, and their company image is more \"high status\" than $TDOC\n* More importance/education on Skin Care, Sex products, and Hair Loss and Care\n* Affordability - Hims & Hers has primary care consultations for $39, which is a nice, consistent price especially when compared to the American healthcare system\n* Their Twitter account posts memes\n\n\nOther competitors: Those random Telehealth apps nobody knows about, Amazon (more pricing power on medicine), CVS/Walgreens/RiteAid (Lol)\n\n\n**Positions:**\n\n\n20 x $15c 4/16\n\n\n10 x $17.5c 5/21 \n\n\n(will be rolling out calls when they get closer to expiry into long term)","created_utc":"2021-03-20 14:09:28","num_comments":70,"score":95,"upvote_ratio":0.81,"is_original_content":false,"permalink":"/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m9clng/hims_hers_dd_the_future_of_pharmacies_and_doctors/","title":"Hims & Hers DD - The future of pharmacies and doctor‚Äôs visits","author":"PokemonInstinct","firstseen":"2021-03-24 21:45:29.944470"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"605bb2f95df7eedfb49c1e64"},"id":"m9c17l","fullname":"t3_m9c17l","selftext":"So I keep hearing that Silver is \"historically undervalued\" and I wanted to do some DD to see how rare it really is, and what the price should be realistically in comparison to the other metals.\n\nTake a look at the numbers and judge for yourselves.\n\nThe big five precious metals are:\n\nPLATINUM\n\nCurrent Price **$1205/Ounce**\n\nTotal Ounces Ever Mined: 350 Million\n\nUses: 60% of total production goes to automotive industry. Current uses are for catalytic converters but as cars switch to EV, will be used for battery cells. Also used in jewelry.\n\nGOLD\n\nCurrent Price: **$1740/Ounce**\n\nTotal Ounces Ever Mined: 10 Billion or a cube 25m on each side.\n\nUses: TO FUCKING BALL OUT OF CONTROL\n\nPALLADIUM\n\nCurrent Price: **$2746/Ounce** (up 12% last month)\n\nTotal Ounces Ever Mined: 24 Million\n\nUses: 60% of total production goes to automotive industry.\n\nRHODIUM\n\nCurrent Price: **$29,000/Ounce** (WTF! up 200% YTD)\n\nTotal Ounces Ever Mined: 70 million\n\nUses: Most commonly used as an alloy agent with other metals, Also used in jewelry, electric contacts and catalytic converters. Very hard substance. But apparently can be replaced with platinum (if you use more platinum).\n\nSILVER\n\nCurrent Price **$26.25/Ounce**\n\nTotal Ounces Ever Mined: 49 Billion mined but only 27 billion remain.\n\nIn 2020, 978M ounces of Silver were produced globally, and the total demand was 963M ounces. But, only 215M ounces were for investment purposes. The remaining silver was used for commercial purposes (475M and and 96M just for solar), jewelry (187M), photography (30M) and silverware (54M). Crazy to think that many people are still buying real silverware (although I hear a lot is plated).\n\nAlmost half of the silver ever mined is now in a landfill. Also, it is not yet economically feasible to scavenge the landfills for salvageable silver based on the price (things aren't that blade runnery yet.)\n\nUses: The best conductor of electricity, used in all electronics and EVs. Silver is also used as an antibacterial agent. Also used as currency throughout history and as a fast way to move large amounts of wealth. The US Constitution explicitly mentions gold and silver as money.\n\nSo....\n\nWhy is the price of silver so low?\n\nIt occurs in the earth's crust at a ratio of 8 to 1 compared to gold yet it's only worth enough to feed a family of four at McDonalds? People have to literally dig this stuff out of the FUCKING GROUND.\n\n*Something doesn't add up.*\n\nThe current price ratio is 65 ounces of silver for 1 ounce of gold. Throughout history, the ratio has remained closer to 16 to 1 which at this gold price would imply a silver price of $112.\n\nThis sounds a little better.\n\nBank manipulation is well known in this space, and the paper market for silver only functions to suppress the price. If trading was conducted in a responsible manner the silver price would be much higher. Yesterday alone, 280 million ounces were bought and sold. This equates to 28% of the yearly mine production. The big banks control the majority of the metals and have unlimited ammunition to short. This happens late at night, when there is no liquidity to push down the price. But the price has recently started to resist these dumps.\n\nBut the tides are turning, someone has been removing physical silver from the COMEX vaults and it is being drained at an alarming rate. This month, 26 million ounces of physical silver has been removed, which is almost four times the normal amount. It has been hypothesized that manufacturers are starting to source their metals from the COMEX directly. Additionally, the Perth Mint has been rumored to have run out of unallocated physical silver bars.\n\nIf there is even a tiny inkling of a bank run on silver, the price will shoot higher. And if you look at how undervalued silver is, both historically and when compared to other precious metals, the trade becomes a no brainer.\n\nThis is one of the last great trades.  They can't hold the ball under water forever.\n\nI would like to see this turn into a transfer of wealth from the blood sucking banks into the hands of us, the people. Silver will always be the people's money and this may be one of our only hopes to preserve our wealth for future generations.","created_utc":"2021-03-20 13:42:58","num_comments":332,"score":293,"upvote_ratio":0.71,"is_original_content":true,"permalink":"/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m9c17l/whats_wrong_with_this_picture_precious_metals_dd/","title":"What's Wrong With This Picture? - Precious Metals DD","author":"dorksgetlaid2","firstseen":"2021-03-24 21:45:29.944848"}

One of the main justifications they gave for this conclusion was that ‚Äúthe number of recent conversations \\[on Reddit\\] including both GME and stimulus is low.‚Äù\n\nAs some of you know, I‚Äôve been collecting data on WSB discussion for quite a while now, and can quantitatively show that to be false.\n\nI'll try to keep this brief, as I know attention spans here are short. Please don't hesitate to ask questions below, and [here's a longer write-up](https://www.reddit.com/user/pdwp90/comments/m8ogb0/the_stimmy_effect/) I did on the \"stimmy effect\" recently.\n\nTo start with, here is a graph of the total number of comments in my data mentioning \"stimulus\" or \"stimmy\" over time:\n\n[Stimulus Comments](https://preview.redd.it/68304hkrr6o61.png?width=1730&format=png&auto=webp&s=89e506d66c60fcfdb2c7f615e53cf952fa4dd522)\n\nHere is a graph of the number of comments in my data that mention BOTH stimulus & GME over time:\n\n[WSB comments discussing stimulus & GME](https://preview.redd.it/f5ubk3hhq6o61.png?width=1730&format=png&auto=webp&s=c3b50e38cb0eafa490bcfeba1bda3b6e023409ce)\n\nThe drop off at the end reflects the fact that it was 3:00pm as I am writing this and the day is only partially completed. One could argue that these numbers should be normalized based on the total of number of comments per day and, while I'd disagree, I'll include that graph below as well:\n\n[Normalized WSB comments discussing stimulus & GME](https://preview.redd.it/003y7k0mq6o61.png?width=1730&format=png&auto=webp&s=3b4b0762cf396708bdef53f795ce84ad7e0c4847)\n\nFrom both of these graphs I see no indication of the number of recent conversations including both GME and stimulus being low, as a matter of fact it has hit all time highs over the last few days Here's a chart of the top 5 days in which stimulus was mentioned the most in my data of WSB daily discussion.\n\n|**Day**|**Stimulus & GME mention count**|\n|:-|:-|\n|3/15/21|124|\n|3/14/21|103|\n|3/16/21|74|\n|3/13/21|69|\n|1/14/21|67|\n\nTo take it a step further, we can look at what % of comments mentioning different stocks also mention stimulus, as I did recently in the graphic below. A larger proportion of comments mentioning $GME on WSB also mention stimulus than for any other major meme stocks, save for $TSLA.\n\n[Most-discussed stocks in 2021 w\\/ \\\\\"stimmy ratio\\\\\"](https://preview.redd.it/d6gj9vj7r6o61.png?width=1072&format=png&auto=webp&s=6d7f1e3d99059a70494a08da9ea571f2832a2359)\n\nI don't know how the conclusion was reached that the number of recent conversations on reddit including GME and stimulus is low. Assuming that this is an honest mistake, I'd encourage BofA, Market Watch, CNBC, or any of the other parties involved to get better data. There are a lot of people out there who have started collecting data on WSB, but not many who do it well and with good intentions. I've been doing it for a while now, and I like to think I fit both those criteria which is why I feel qualified to write this post.\n\nNote:  I don‚Äôt have stake in $GME and don‚Äôt actively trade a portfolio, in order to avoid perceptions of bias in my analysis.

You're almost guaranteed to profit by betting against me and as such, neither is financial advise. The following is my observations.\n\nGenerally speaking I genuinely believe that immunity and the progress of vaccination  is oversold and that the broader market is hyped on fugazi. The facts remain:\n\nThe projected immunity of the US population (stated that 70-90% being fully vaccinated) is around Oct-Nov^(1).\n\nThe US awaits the Trial of AstraZeneca before FDA approval (I'll return to why I estimate this approval won't change much).\n\n\"Only\" 12.x% of the US is currently 2-dose vaccinated.\n\nAAL is nearing in on the stock price around $30 prior to Covid-19 restrictions and the market fall in March 2020 - and that's even with their own projections of Q1 capacity being down 45%^(2).\n\nThe projection^(1) estimates \\~50% being 2-dose vaccinated during the summer months (June-August).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Why FDA approval of AstraZeneca won't change the projections imo**\n\nCVST is the short answer. I know fuck-shit about medice or the likes however, I do follow the vaccine status of the EU where I'm residing and the increased number of reports of Blood Clots in the brain (the ones being smooth on you) post AstraZeneca Jabs (*I'm not myself saying they are directly linked, others are indicating this though*). As of writing there has been:\n\n* 2 Deaths in Denmark\n* 1 Death in Norway\n* 1 Death in Spain\n* 1 Death in Austria\n\nThat *may* have been linked to the injection of AstraZeneca. The EMA had a conclusion on their hearing the 18th that stated \"The benefint (READ: Herd immunity) outweighs the risk\"^(3). Norwegian researches came to the conclusion that it was linked to the Astra vaccine^(4).\n\nAnd in the context of the US we'll need to look at **risk factors** for CVST, where one in adults is Obesity^(5). According to CDC above 40% was Obese through 2017-2018^(6) (too lazy to find newer numbers).\n\nAll the above nonsense is fine, what matters is **public perception**. Choose between Pfizer/Moderna or a Vaccine that in the media is portrayed as only \\~60% effective^(7) and has resulted in blood clots. *I know which one I'd prefer.*\n\nOh yeah, Ursula von der Leyen threatens to halt export of Astra jabs until the EU has had their promised deliveries, which are delayed and pose a risk to the EU herd immunity progress. (*Tinfoil-hat on* which may be why the EMA and WHO really needs to calm the tits down of the general public surrounding the vaccine? *Tinfoil-hat off*).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**So, back to AAL**\n\nHow will this affect AAL leading into the summer you ask. Less travel. Less travel than anticipated at least.\n\nBut, what about easing the travel restrictions?\n\nWell, there may be *domestically*, idk about internal US policy but from my point of view, jamming many people together in a metal tube for hours while still not immune in the herd might be just about as dumb as buying these puts.\n\nInternationally, I highly doubt we'll see travel unless the vaccination pasport is introduced, which projection wise only half of the US population would be able to supply at that time. Iceland already did this.\n\nWe're seeing more and more evidence for a third wave in Europe with Paris going in lockdown^(8).\n\nOh, right, the negative impact 2020 had and Covid overall on flying, cruises and the likes is also underplayed imo. I think we'll see some time go by before we're back to anything remotely close to pre-covid, if we ever get there..\n\nAnother observation is that the reported passengers while increasing in to double and nearly tripple from Q2 to Q3 and Q4 respectively, there isn't much upside to be seen in the Qx reportings that yield -2.07B, -2.4B and -2.18B.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Confirmation Bias**\n\n[**https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lr6ckb/if\\_youve\\_never\\_bought\\_puts\\_heres\\_a\\_free\\_one/**](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lr6ckb/if_youve_never_bought_puts_heres_a_free_one/)\n\n[**https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m29sc7/aal\\_huge\\_debt\\_relief\\_and\\_why\\_it\\_is\\_time\\_to\\_sell/**](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m29sc7/aal_huge_debt_relief_and_why_it_is_time_to_sell/)\n\nI've excluded all the posts that goes against but you can do a quick search yourself: [https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=aal](https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=aal)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What am I looking at buying**\n\nPUTS. Puts around a strike price of $24 since I'm too scared to go hardcore short via CFDs (which we Europoors can). I also need to keep up my trackrecord of shorting via Puts which is 100% loss üòé\n\nI'll be attempting to gather Put options with strike $24, Expiry  20th of August and hopefully a premium of 2.0-3.0 which seems about adequate for my pessimistic perception of the aviation sector going into Q2-Q3 2021.\n\nIm poor af so may only be able to get 2 contracts at this premium. We'll see. I'll update when (if i get the premium i want) the options.\n\nAs always, *not financial advise.*\n\n\\---\n\n**References**\n\n^(1) [https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/02/20/us/us-herd-immunity-covid.html](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/02/20/us/us-herd-immunity-covid.html) & [https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/vaccine-benefits.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/vaccine-benefits.html) states that it's safer to use the vaccinated than previously affected to get herd immunity.\n\n^(2) [https://americanairlines.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/american-airlines-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2020](https://americanairlines.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/american-airlines-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2020)\n\n^(3) [https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/covid-19-vaccine-astrazeneca-benefits-still-outweigh-risks-despite-possible-link-rare-blood-clots](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/covid-19-vaccine-astrazeneca-benefits-still-outweigh-risks-despite-possible-link-rare-blood-clots)\n\n^(4) [https://sciencenorway.no/covid19/norwegian-experts-say-deadly-blood-clots-were-caused-by-the-astrazeneca-covid-vaccine/1830510](https://sciencenorway.no/covid19/norwegian-experts-say-deadly-blood-clots-were-caused-by-the-astrazeneca-covid-vaccine/1830510)\n\n^(5) [https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/cerebral-venous-sinus-thrombosis](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/cerebral-venous-sinus-thrombosis)\n\n^(6) [https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/data/adult.html](https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/data/adult.html)\n\n^(7) [https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail/the-oxford-astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-what-you-need-to-know](https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail/the-oxford-astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-what-you-need-to-know)\n\n^(8) [https://edition.cnn.com/2021/03/19/europe/coronavirus-europe-third-wave-intl/index.html](https://edition.cnn.com/2021/03/19/europe/coronavirus-europe-third-wave-intl/index.html)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\--\n\nEdit:\n\nBought 2 puts since I'm a poor fuck that can't afford more.

{"_id":{"$oid":"605bb2f95df7eedfb49c1e6e"},"id":"m93mec","fullname":"t3_m93mec","selftext":"So, the news broke yesterday that UWMC will not be included in the Russell 1000 or 3000. This justifiably has some investors upset and ready to sell. I‚Äôm going to make a case for holding, or even adding more. \n\nI previously made a DD that was fairly popular where I called UWMC a swing play, a value play, and a long term hold rolled into one. Well, the swing play already happened with the run to $12. There was another run to $10 recently as well. We could have seen a bigger swing with index inclusion, but that‚Äôs not happening now. I banked $4,000 on those swings, so I can‚Äôt complain too much there. However, I understand that some people bought in the run-up with higher prices in mind. There were some posts on here with stupid price targets and ‚Äúshort squeeze‚Äù hype. I called these posts out as I saw them. I never thought UWM was wise to jump into for a squeeze alone, even with high short interest, and some here definitely FOMOd into some really bad DD. In fact, I think the guy who kept hyping a squeeze deleted his account. \n\nBut the truth is that many bought at the $10+ mark and now feel lost. Well, this post is for you. \n\nFirst of all, I agree that not being included in the indices is bad news. I thought this would be a good catalyst myself. However, I also believe that there is an overreaction here. UWMC may very well have ticked up a couple of percentage points on Russell inclusions, but I think that for the long term, this doesn‚Äôt change too much. \n\nThis is why, even without Russell inclusion, UWMC may be a worthy part of your portfolio:\n\n\n- Price targets and analyst ratings for UWMC:\n\n4 buys, 1 hold.\n\nLow: 10.50\nAverage: 11.70\nHigh: 13.50\n\nThis represents a 19-53% upside from current share price. \n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/UWMC/research-ratings\n\n- This company is trading at value multiples, with a P/E in the 6-7 range and 1.83b revenue in the most recent quarter. More quarters with minuscule interest rates are on the horizon, and I would be shocked if UWM doesn‚Äôt put up monster numbers. I think they will likely upgrade their dividend and make a run up over the course of the year. Analysts seem to agree with this outlook. The fed reiterated that rates are going nowhere.\n\n- There was recently an insider buy of 60,000 shares at around $8. This was more than a double down on his previous 50,000 shares. If he‚Äôs that bullish at $8, then I would say anything below $8.50 is a great buy. Even at the current $8.80 price, we are only 10% above the insider purchase. \n\n- Even if there is no dividend upgrade, the current dividend is 40 cents a year, which comes out to 4.5% of the current price. This is a very solid dividend for an income play. \n\n- Earnings will likely be in early May. With no index inclusion, I would say late April would be the next catalyst to watch for a run up. If you really want to sell, I would advise waiting until that time rather than taking a big loss Monday. \n\n- As a result of the recent spat with RKT, UWMC has enlisted a minimum of 65% and likely in the end around 75-80% of independent brokers who previously worked with UWMC and RKT to sign an addendum that restricts them from working with RKT. Considering the wholesale channel is expected to increase its share of the market until 2025, this gives UWMC a giant advantage in capturing more market share. (I‚Äôm bullish on RKT too for different reasons, but UWMC is the king of brokers in the mortgage industry and will win the broker battle IMO)\n\n- EPS is expected to INCREASE in 2021 per analyst estimates. This is opposed to competitors that are expected to have a slower 2021. And when interest rates do increase, UWM expects to become an even more powerful influence in the industry due to their reliance on purchase business rather than refinance. \n\n- UWM is investing in technology by the billions, and they already have far and away the fastest closing times in the industry. They hold what one might call a ‚Äúmoat.‚Äù That‚Äôs how you grow a company. \n\nSome bear points:\n\n- The RKT ultimatum could lead to litigation and bad press. I don‚Äôt think anything will come of it, but bad press could bring the share price down. \n\n- The market could collapse/the housing market could cool off. I‚Äôd say that if you‚Äôre in the industry, you know that the housing market isn‚Äôt cooling off any time soon. However, I won‚Äôt claim to be all-knowing, so perhaps this could happen.\n\n- Interest rates could rise substantially, and much sooner than expected. Highly unlikely, but possible. \n\n- Maybe the RKT ultimatum pushes business away from UWM, and they lose out to RKT. I‚Äôd say this is the biggest risk right now to be honest, but I do believe UWM will come out on top based on my experience in the industry and based off of what is being reported. I have also heard some personal stories about the situation. However, if UWM starts to lose more market share, that changes everything. \n\n- The stock market simply undervalues mortgage companies right now, and one could argue that this may never change. I would say that we are already seeing it change with RKT and UWM, and that it will gradually change as these companies continue to put up huge numbers. \n\n\nLet me reiterate: UWMC was never a GME type play. It was a good swing play, and now it is a great value and long term play. I would spend some time thinking about whether that matches your investing goals, and if not, get out on Monday or hold until the earnings run-up.\n\nI am personally going to be buying the dip if it comes on Monday. Considering the current share price provides 20% upside to the LOWEST analyst estimates, I am excited to buy the dip to be honest. \n\nThis post is not for my own benefit. My average is pretty good and I am prepared to average down. I just know that some of the people here really got screwed by some bad DD, and wanted to provide my own outlook on why you may be fine. My current position is 1250 @ 8.47.","created_utc":"2021-03-20 05:32:25","num_comments":166,"score":242,"upvote_ratio":0.76,"is_original_content":false,"permalink":"/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m93mec/uwmc_not_added_to_russel_indiceswhat_now_why_you/","title":"UWMC not added to Russel Indices...What now?

I read somewhere he holds 90% of the company. No wonder index did not want to get involved. If you want to hold 90% of the company you should have left it private. Why even go public?\n\nIndex or no index, the stock is still undervalued by all metrics. The only problem in my opinion is that CEO is holding too much stake in the company. He wants to get rich of index buying, but they are not stupid. Why would one single person hold 90% of the company? If you want your company to be private then don't go public. There are many great companies like IKEA and Lego that are private because the families that own them did not want to sell their shares.\n\nBrace yourself for bagholding.

The stock is still \\~50% off Jan 2020 highs, IMO putting it solidly in undervalued territory.\n\n**The Turn**\n\n<political statements deleted>, one analysis is that things might not be as bad as they seem in the Florida of South America (shoutout to @[CallsOnAlcoholism](https://www.reddit.com/user/CallsOnAlcoholism/)) and even if they are, they have until September to figure it out. Other bullish signals:\n\n\\- The Brazilian Central Bank made use of a recently passed autonomy law (limiting exec/legislative interference) by increasing its benchmark interest rate to 2.75% \\[larger than expected 75 bp increase compared to 50 bp expected\\] and they signalled a repeat at their next meeting in May. Rising interest rates are generally good for bank stocks as they increase revenue/margins. Whether they are similarly good for emerging economy bank stocks, I guess I will find out.\n\n\\- The three analysts I could find that follow this stock returned an average price target of %7.50 (just confirmation bias, analysts are mostly tea-leaf readers).\n\n\\- Minimal short interest 25M shares (0.6% of float).\n\n**The Prestige**\n\nBrazil has a funny trend of shitting the bed when you expect it to pay off, and paying off when you expect it to shit the bed. My analysis is that the negative catalysts have been priced in, blood is in the streets, and the probability of positive catalysts appearing before September is greater than 0.5. Shares are likely a better play than options, substantial return potential and lower risk.\n\nObviously the best play is to avoid entirely (see previous 100% loss), Brazil is a crazy place. \n\nO demonio s√≥ tenta quem que esta mais perto de deus.","created_utc":"2021-03-20 02:09:22","num_comments":15,"score":12,"upvote_ratio":0.64,"is_original_content":false,"permalink":"/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m910wi/rubadubdub_itub_20/","title":"Rubadubdub ITUB (2.0)","author":"investporra","firstseen":"2021-03-24 21:45:29.949658"}

As of August 1, 2020, it operated 259 Academy Sports + Outdoors retail locations in 16 states and three distribution centers located in Katy, Texas, Twiggs County, Georgia, and Cookeville, Tennessee. The company also sells merchandise to customers via academy.com website. Academy Sports and Outdoors, Inc. was founded in 1938 and is based in Katy, Texas.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI even saw one that described the company as \"catering to local flavor\" by selling crawfish boilers....\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNeed more info?  90 mil outstanding shares, 30 mil float and 12.5 mil shares shorted (40.3%) as of 2/26/21\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR   Potential to Squeeze?

I might add THEY paid for. Yes, even the FUD is free advertising. Remember there‚Äôs no such thing as BAD press. \n(The visitor rate is an actual number from the internet anyone can look it up) \n\nI ran an e-commerce site I know how this shit works and you‚Äôre sooooooooo fucked!!!!!\n\nIf you use normal website sale conversations it‚Äôs usually about 10% of visitors. So GameStop right now gets about 415,000 orders a month on their site and if you just say each one of them is JUST a game nothing else you‚Äôre looking at probably an avg sale of $60. So if we just say the site does this piddly little amount /sale you have about 24.9 mill in sales/month. Now as we all know but maybe Melvin/citadel haven‚Äôt figured it out yet they have made massive enemies out of every single stockholder. Meaning that each and every single GameStop holder will never buy anything with regards to gaming anywhere else.....EVER. Along with the fact that now every single fucking person on Planet earth has and will hear about GameStop. So now let‚Äôs say that visitor rate increases 3x that‚Äôs 12mill/month and that turns into 1.2 mill sales/month with an avg of $60. Woof you can see where this is going. Can‚Äôt you? You(Melvin/Citadel) have created a fully functional lifestyle gaming brand that HASN‚ÄôT even started yet and you‚Äôre shorting has given it a share price of $200.

So please take what I say here with a grain of salt.

We know him as r/DeepF\\*ckingValue, otherwise known as RoaringKitty on YouTube and Twitter. His ape name is Keith Gill, and was recently put in the hot seat at the recent Hearing regarding the trading halts that occurred in January, which ultimately prevented the squeeze from being squoze by eliminating a vast percentage of buying pressure. \n\nHe likes the stock, but is not recommending that we buy it. He's recommending that we do our own DD, and dive into the rabbit hole of a crooked-fucked market ran by greed and manipulation that we've been watching day in, and day out for the past two months now, and the mess that they've created regarding short interest, failed to delivers, etc.\n\nAMC happened to be in the mix during all this, and up to this point has survived as capable, and has saved AMC entirely. \n\nBoth of these stocks have a great support system behind them, and that in and of itself is why we will not fail.\n\nAll we have to do is put up with the bullshit that is coming our way, and man, it's quite spectacular the lengths that these hedgefucks are willing to go to in order to try and shake us out of our positions.\n\nITS NOT FUCKING WORKING.\n\n**WHERE ARE WE NOW?**\n\nHere we fucking are, March of 2021, and GameStop is trading at $200/share after reaching a peak of $350 last week before the stoploss jerkfest of the century took place. \n\nAMC has been receiving great news as of late, and has had a lot of insider buying taking place that points to positive outlook moving forward. They now have 98% of theatres open, and the remaining will follow suit later this month.\n\nEDIT: HERE ARE LINKS TO THE AQUISITIONS\n\nhttps://bulletin.webull.com/20210317/158812/43661662a0bb76607f86a5bcb4708c19/89919?theme=2&_v=1&color=1&hl=en&sp=1&hl=en&theme=1\n https://bulletin.webull.com/20210317/158812/43661662a0bb76607f86a5bcb4708c19/55225?theme=2&_v=1&color=1&hl=en&sp=1&hl=en&theme=1\n\nhttps://bulletin.webull.com/20210317/158812/43661662a0bb76607f86a5bcb4708c19/28949?theme=2&_v=1&color=1&hl=en&sp=1&hl=en&theme=1\n\nhttps://bulletin.webull.com/20210317/158812/43661662a0bb76607f86a5bcb4708c19/87923?theme=2&_v=1&color=1&hl=en&sp=1&hl=en&theme=1\n\nhttps://bulletin.webull.com/20210317/158812/43661662a0bb76607f86a5bcb4708c19/82461?theme=2&_v=1&color=1&hl=en&sp=1&hl=en&theme=1\n\nThese are just a few. There are more.\n\nBelow is a list of positive reasons why we need to hold on to these two stocks until this event plays out, as we're living in times that are uncharted and have not yet been witnessed in finance. We are all a little piece of collective history!\n\nRemember, apes, when in doubt, remember these things:\n\n1. The hedgefunds are BLATANTLY manipulating the system in their favor using various methods such as naked shorting, short laddering, bid/ask spread manipulation, etc. Why would they be performing all of this fuckery? Because we have them by the balls. All we have to do is continue to buy and hold until they destroy themselves from the inside out.\n\n2. A news article was released today stating that the Fed will no longer be providing \"Emergency Relief\" to big banks on Wal Street. Interesting timing, don't you think? A link to this article can be found here:  [Federal Reserve to End Emergency Capital Relief for Big Banks - WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/federal-reserve-to-end-emergency-capital-relief-for-big-banks-11616158811) \n\n3. We've determined Robinhood needs to be crucified, as all they've done is essentially take your money, data, and export it to a third party for insane amounts of cash, all while providing bogus shares to its' customers, and while causing the trading halt that prevented the squeeze in January. HOWEVER! Think of what this means. They fucked up big time. Not only did this action spark an investigation into their fuckery, but has also lead to two Hearings, with a third to follow. Not sure if anything will come of it, but the best part and silver lining is that ROBINHOOD IS NOW EXPOSED TO RETAIL TRADERS LIKE YOU AND I. They're the first domino in this corrupt witch-hunt to fall, and they won't be the last. Not only that, but now the squeeze will be even bigger than it could've been before, which will make for more tendies. :)\n\n4. There has been a DTCC rule change that will go into effect at some point. If someone has some information on this that is VERIFIABLE, please share, as there seems to be no clear cut answer for when and if this rule has been taken into effect. In a nutshell, the rule change is allowing the DTCC to have daily calls to determine short positions, and the second part would allow the DTCC to forcibly liquidate any short positions that they feel would be too risky or abusive in nature. THIS IS HUGE. If it comes to fruition? We'll have to wait and see.\n\n5. GME has an earnings report that is due next week. If they crush EPS, I strongly feel this could potentially be a catalyst going into next week. \n\n6. Bots and shills have been filling the comment sections trying to get us out of our positions.

I was curious to try to predict exactly what Russell 1000 and 3000 inclusion would do.\n\nFor those who don't know, these are both market-cap weighted funds.  The Russell 3000 is the 3000 biggest companies in the US, which makes them about 98% of the US stock market by market cap.  The Russell 1000 is the biggest 1000 of the Russell 3000, which makes them about 90% of the stock market.\n\nSince the whole US stock market is a bit above $50T, that makes the Russell 3000 about $50T and the Russell 1000 about $45T.  They are honestly not that different, the Russell 3000 just contains an extra 2000 companies which barely move the needle, because it's market-cap weighted (not equal-weight)\n\nOk so once I figured that out, my next question was, exactly how many funds track these indexes?  The answer was disappointing.  There are two main ETFs for each (iShares and Vanguard).   And then there are a bunch of little mutual funds.  I couldn't get a complete list but I doubt that all of this combined adds up to much more than $50B in assets (comparitively, SPY is just one ETF and it has $330B in net assets, and that doesn't count all the mutual funds that track the S&P 500)\n\nSo as a really rough estimate, 0.11% of a Russell 1000 company's market cap will be in these funds.  (maybe a little more, like 0.12% or 0.13%)\n\nThe one thing that UWMC had going for it is that it's market cap is large and the float is small -- only 6% of the market cap.  So that means that in order to buy 0.11% of the market cap, they have to buy about 1.83% of the float.  Let's round up to 2% because I didn't look at all the mutual funds.  I could not really find a good source of data here.\n\nConclusion:  ETFs and mutual funds need to buy about 2% of UWMC's float.  That's about 2 million shares.  Average daily volume is about 10M shares.  There might be a small boost but this is not a massive squeeze or anything.\n\nS&P 500 would be a much bigger deal but they have requirements on the float for precisely this reason.  UWMC will never be in the S&P until they release more shares into the float.","created_utc":"2021-03-19 20:31:29","num_comments":65,"score":114,"upvote_ratio":0.74,"is_original_content":false,"permalink":"/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m8vckk/uwmc_russell_inclusion/","title":"UWMC Russell Inclusion","author":"Keith_13","firstseen":"2021-03-24 21:45:29.958070"}

For reference lets look at the last two times the MACD histogram was negative:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[1\\/27-2\\/26](https://preview.redd.it/n35a3qlkb2o61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=e1e93ef2c67df5f7598139d211144db90b76e987)\n\nIn this example (2/4-2/24), we can see that bearish sentiment lasted about 14 trading days. We should note however, that this is right after huge volume and sudden spike in price.\n\nNow another example:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[12\\/8-1\\/13](https://preview.redd.it/0x6qf54ob2o61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=b10e245f52cb96382e7eeca802024346475218c7)\n\nLooking back from 12/10-1/12 we can see that GME was following a 6 to 8 day bearish to bullish trend. Important to note is that these trends did not spike the price too much and volume was relatively low.\n\nNow looking ahead to 3/22 and onward, I can safely predict that there should be a bearish trend. This doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean prices will dramatically plummet but institutions know that trying to raise prices against negative MACD momentum isn‚Äôt favorable. Also, I can also say that if a bearish trend starts, it should last something like 6-14 days. Our most recent bullish trend had decent volume and there was also a pretty dramatic price change, and so I think the real number will in the middle of those two extremes.\n\nNow I know that is a very large window of time, but it really does depend on what happens during the next two weeks to determine if the MACD histogram will overturn. Events like the earnings report on 3/23, and if RC announces a CEO position could help overturn sentiment.\n\nI'm sorry if this doesn't feed your confirmation bias or if you think im trying to spread FUD. I just wanted to share so we can make educated trades and stay in the game longer so we can get this thing to squeeze!\n\nObligatory emojis:  üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ\n\nEdit: Changed 'Trigger' to 'Confirm', As the comments pointed out 3/12 would've been the start to bearish sentiment","created_utc":"2021-03-19 18:45:31","num_comments":55,"score":146,"upvote_ratio":0.79,"is_original_content":false,"permalink":"/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m8t9nq/gme_conservative_outlook_technical_analysis_macd/","title":"$GME ‚ÄúConservative‚Äù Outlook; Technical Analysis ‚Äì MACD, W%R, DMI Based","author":"Polkm23","firstseen":"2021-03-24 21:45:29.961776"}

(It also wouldn‚Äôt have mattered if they closed above $14 or below $200) \n\n**First** those large prints you see on the tape at 4 PM? That‚Äôs NORMAL. Every day at 16:00:02 the first NYSE closing print goes up. This tends to be larger on all Fridays, triple, and quad witching days due to opex. https://www.nyse.com/network/article/nyse-closing-auction?utm_source=homepage&utm_medium=banner\n\nThis is not mAnIPulATIOn. This is how the market works. The reason you see the price jump/ change right at 4:00 is you‚Äôre watching the tick data until 3:59:59 then at 4:00:02 they put up the first closing auction print. \n\nOn to the options component of our class - \n\nObviously explaining gamma, delta, dealer hedging and open interest is really not getting through to you smooth brains. So I‚Äôm going to try a practical approach.\n\nUse the TWO WRINKLES YOU HAVE and think for ONE SECOND. Would the option market work if every time a dealer sold a call option they just sat around and waited until Friday afternoon to figure out if they needed to have shares to deliver for In the money (ITM) options?? Would that make ANY SENSE?! That people went and bought $200 3/19 GME options 2 weeks ago for $20 and the dealer just sat in their chair staring at their screen? And at 4 PM today dealers short calls from $125 to $200 went ‚Äúoh well looks like I‚Äôm short $300M of GME I have to go buy next week.‚Äù\n\nOF COURSE NOT. This is what we mean by delta hedging. They have already bought stock as a hedge. As the price went up they bought more. That‚Äôs the ‚Äúgamma squeeze.‚Äù\n\nAs people close out their positions on Friday the dealers are unwinding. Some options will be exercised and... good news for the dealers! They have the stock! Because they hedged it!\n\nThere‚Äôs all sorts of slightly technical reasons there‚Äôs small overhangs at 4:00 but it‚Äôs mostly done. \n\nSecond practical point- HOW MANY FUCKING TIMES DOES THIS HAVE TO HAPPEN FOR YOU TO REALIZE ITS NOT HOW IT WORKS? Every Friday we hear ‚Äúif the stock closes above/ below X then Y will happen next week.‚Äù And it doesn‚Äôt. Because QUITE OBVIOUSLY if that was the case you would see HUGE movements AH. Spoiler alert- you guys aren‚Äôt the only ones that can see open interest. Put on your practical hat again. Don‚Äôt you think if the entire street saw 30M options ITM and thought that many shares needed to be bought Monday they would do it... now?\n\nOptions markets matter and you should learn more because it can illuminate what‚Äôs happening in stocks (Ie last week someone bought a whole lot of GME calls and set off this rally) but price at expiry matters very little. There‚Äôs slightly more to it (you can look up ‚Äúpin risk‚Äù and ‚ÄúMax pain‚Äù if you‚Äôre interested I‚Äôm trying to get the most basic concepts across here). The reason AMC traded in such a tight range is because it got pinned at the $14 price due to large OI. This is not manipulation and is just due to mechanical hedging by dealers.","created_utc":"2021-03-19 17:44:36","num_comments":323,"score":2016,"upvote_ratio":0.92,"is_original_content":false,"permalink":"/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m8rx62/why_closing_at_14_and_200_does_not_matter_lets_do/","title":"Why closing at $14 and $200 DOES NOT MATTER- let‚Äôs do this again","author":"Verb0182","firstseen":"2021-03-24 21:45:29.964859"}

{"_id":{"$oid":"605bb2fc5df7eedfb49c1ead"},"id":"m8r4yt","fullname":"t3_m8r4yt","selftext":"There has been a lot of very inaccurate and false information being posted about the borrow availability in GME shares. The most common one is that IBorrowdesk (IBKR) is reflective of the total availability of borrow in the marketplace. THIS IS FALSE!!!  iBorrowdesk as well as most other offerings of the same sort from Fido, Schwab etc mostly just show the availability of shares on their platform at that moment in time. Ironically this means the more their clients buy GME on margin the more borrow availability there will be. \n\nTHE REAL BORROW MARKET AVAILABILITY. \n\nIn its most basic form, the largest holders of securities are also the largest lenders of securities. Hate to break it to y‚Äôall but there are a ton of institutional holders of this stock. When an institution such as pension fund, mutual fund insurance company buys GME ( or any other stock for that matter) those shares are held at their custodian. A Custody bank such as JPM, Citi, State Street, BONY aggregates these assets and if the pension fund is in their lending program (most are) those shares are lent to broker dealers. The large broker dealers all have Prime Brokerage groups that custody assets for Hedge Funds. One of the main functions of a Prime Broker is to lend stock to Hedge Funds to short. BDs act as the middle man between the Custody bank and the hedge fund. How does a PB know where to borrow GME you ask?  Easy, the Custody banks broadcast ALL of their stocks available for lending to Broker Dealers. The PBs aggregate this borrow availability from all of the Custody banks and broadcast this information to Hedge Funds. Included in this aggregation would be any positions that are available at the PB from their long clients who purchases those securities on margin. So each day every PB in the market aggregates all of the borrow availability they have access to and broadcasts it to HFS to short. Here‚Äôs the rub. THIS INFORMATION IS NOT AVAILABLE TO THE  GENERAL PUBLIC!!!!!  Securities lending or stock loan is a purposely OPAQUE market. This allows the PBs to keep control over who gets borrow and at what cost.  On that topic of Cost, given that the general public does not have the same access to this information, the COST to  borrow a security can often be a more accurate reflection on borrow availability. Case in point: When GME first squeezed in late January there was ZERO borrow available to short. As such the cost to borrow the security went as high as 200%. Think about that. That high cost is untenable and impossible for a HF to stay short for very long. Obviously they covered a load of stock and the borrow cost came in and availability went back up. \n\nEVERY BD(PB)‚Äôs ABILITY TO BORROW STOCK IS DIFFERENT \n\nThink of hard to borrow securities like GME as an allocation of shares in IPO process. Not anyone can rock up and get an allocation of an IPO. The same is true of an allocation of stock borrow on a hard to borrow or ‚Äúspecial‚Äù security like GME. The Custody bank will allocate limited shares of a hard to borrow to those borrowers (BD&PBs) that pay them the most revenue throughout the year. It stands to reason that the largest clients of the custody banks are the largest PBS that have enormous borrow demand. Thus BONY will lend GME to a GS or JPM before lending it to IBKR or Fido (both with very small PB groups). You with me so far???  So let‚Äôs look at the loan side of that transaction. BONY lends GME to GS. Now GS will lend that scarce resource of GME borrow to HF clients that pay them the most revenue throughout the year. Thus GS is more likely to lend GME in this scenario to a Citadel(I know I know), Bridgewater or DE Shaw vs a small 50mmAUM hedge fund. \n\nCONTROL AND AGGREGATION OF BORROW MARKET AVAILABILITY. \n\nAlthough the transparency into stock borrow availability is non existent for individual investors it is vastly different and very transparent to stock borrow participants (CUSTODY BANKS, BD/PBs). The largest stock loan participants have created an industry utility they control that aggregates each participants borrow availability. They submit total shares available for borrow by firm aggregate it all and distribute back to its participants ONLY!!!  So a stock loan trader at one of these firms can simply type in a ticker and see pretty much the entirety of the stock borrow availability as well as the cost!!! Because the BD/PBs & Custidy banks control this information they reveal only a subset to non participants such as the actual long holder (Pension plan, Mutual fund) and Hedge Funds. This is a main reason why large HFs have multiple PBs. Because everyone‚Äôs stock borrow capability is different, they want access to as many avenues to borrow stock as possible. \n\nThe only way for an individual to anywhere close to an accurate number of borrow availability would be to call each of the large PBs and ask for the info. Obviously this is not going to happen. I happen to know several stock loan participants very well and can tell you that there are MILLIONS OF SHARES OF GME TO BORROW RIGHT NOW AND FOR THE PAST MONTH!!!!!  \n\nGiven that, the best indicator of whether or not there is a lot of borrow is the COST to borrow which is more readily available through your BD. Even if they aren‚Äôt showing you availability they probably still show the cost to borrow. Generally speaking, any cost to borrow below 10% implies there is borrow available. At .5% it is virtually a LIQUID or ‚ÄúGC‚Äù (general collateral) borrow. A further reference point would be RKT which squeezed several weeks ago. There was Very little to no borrow availability as evidenced by its 30% borrow cost at the time. \n\nDon‚Äôt even get me started on the availability of shares for retail to short. I generally DO NOT recommend retail investors going short. It is a sure fire way to go broke. That said even though your broker may show you ZERO borrow to go short, I GUARANTEE they are giving availability to their HF clients.   \n\nHope that helps. It does feel fairly rigged at times given the lack of borrow market transparency. I just hate to think individuals are drawing the wrong conclusions because iBorrow or their BD is showing no borrow. In the case of GME this has been the case all day today. Rest assured THERE ARE MILLIONS OF GME SHARES AVAILABLE TO SHORT.","created_utc":"2021-03-19 17:08:18","num_comments":119,"score":333,"upvote_ratio":0.85,"is_original_content":false,"permalink":"/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m8r4yt/setting_the_record_straight_on_borrow/","title":"SETTING THE RECORD STRAIGHT ON BORROW AVAILABILITY IN GME","author":"Germanicusss","firstseen":"2021-03-24 21:45:32.747785"}

Very rare for winemakers to go public.\n\nThis is the perfect stonk and I have been doing some DD over the last few years before they even thought about going public.\n\nTheir product is great üç∑üç∑üç∑. No idea about the financial details but here are the two scenarios I see:\n\n**Scenario 1**\n\nThe stonk goes up üöÄüöÄüöÄ. You are happy and can buy expensive wine without feeling guilty üç∑üç∑üç∑. After all the wine paid for itself with the gainz. Stonk goes up more and you can buy more wine. It‚Äôs a self feeding circle.\n\n**Scenario 2**\n\nThe stonk goes down üò≥. You are sad for a moment and drown your sorrows in some wine üç∑üç∑üç∑. The more it dropped that day, the more wine you have to drink and buy. That helps the company and the stonk will go up again üöÄüöÄüöÄ.\n\nDisclaimer for Scenario 2: Stonks usually don‚Äôt go down, so this is more a theoretical case. As of this writing NAPA has never closed at a loss üöÄüöÄüöÄ.\n\n**The greeks**\n\nI studied the Greeks as well. They love wine. So no showstopper there either in case you‚Äôre into options. And good wine becomes more valuable when you hold, so no danger from theta here.\n\n**The squeeze scenario**\n\nThey squeeze grapes for about 1.4M cases of wine per year \\[1\\]. That is 16.8M bottles. r/wallstreetbetscurrently has 9.6M Degenerates. If everyone buys two bottles that‚Äôd be 114% of the yearly supply (aka float). That‚Äôs enough to make the price (of the wine) skyrocket as all the fancy restaurants scramble to get their demand filled (usually only about 39% go to retail investors like us \\[2\\]). That will then make the stock go to the moon üöÄüöÄüöÄ.\n\nNow you can diamond hand üíéüôåüíéüôå the wine and the stock and make double the money.\n\n**TLDR**\n\nStonk goes red, drink more red until stonk goes green, then drink more red.\n\nPS: This is not financial advice. Drink responsibly. Don‚Äôt drink and drive.\n\nPPS: I own 30 stocks and a bottle of wine. Planning to buy more.\n\n**Sources**\n\n\\[1\\] [https://www.winespectator.com/articles/duckhorn-files-papers-to-go-public-with-stock-offering](https://www.winespectator.com/articles/duckhorn-files-papers-to-go-public-with-stock-offering)\n\n\\[2\\] [https://www.winespectator.com/articles/duckhorn-debuts-on-new-york-stock-exchange](https://www.winespectator.com/articles/duckhorn-debuts-on-new-york-stock-exchange)","created_utc":"2021-03-19 16:52:59","num_comments":100,"score":150,"upvote_ratio":0.82,"is_original_content":false,"permalink":"/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m8qsqz/napa_went_public_its_the_perfect_stock/","title":"NAPA went public.

Traditional and pure-play companies deserves a low forward P/E and P/S because they don't have the potential to scale up, innovate, and revolutionize their industry - they are only there to make constant small profit for shareholders. This is why these companies will eventually have constant dividend and not reinvest back into the company expansion. Makes for good retirement investment where you want constant income. On the other hand, tech companies need to have either a new technology/product or have some way to digitally transform the industry that can quickly scale.\n\nRKT has spent billions of dollars creating their own broker tools that's customizable, as well as investing in data analytics and AI-assisted automation. They have a 2500-strong software team in Detroit. RKT is not just a mortgage company with an app (although I've heard their app is pretty good). Just look at their acquisitions and some of their other businesses:\n\n1. Nexsys Technologies makes a platform for mortgage lenders that automate homeowner insurance verification, and is being integrated with Lemonade\n2. Lendesk, a Canadian aquisition that makes end-to-end digital mortgage solutions\n3. forsalebyowner is a property listing site, kinda like zillow and redfin\n4. Finally, their flagship rocket mortgage/quicken loans is the first digital mortgage experience - they are the ones who brought on the digital revolution of the mortgage industry. They are the real OGs and are continuing to innovate.\n\nIf you think Lemonade is a tech company (it is), then RKT is a tech company. Even more, it's a tech company that has succeeded in its own field and is rapidly expanding/acquiring. \n\nOn the other hand, everyone is familiar with the feud between RKT and UWMC, and arguments for which is a better company. While I think UWMC has done well in recent year in terms of rapidly expanding in the broker channel, I don' think they are a tech company and thus shouldn't have a long term high forward valuation. Their flagship platform for brokers, Blink+, is a third party software that they pay per use (see their [S1 filing](https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-016729/)). So here they save the initial investment that makes the finances look better for IPO, but will eat into their margins later.","created_utc":"2021-03-19 15:10:27","num_comments":66,"score":205,"upvote_ratio":0.78,"is_original_content":false,"permalink":"/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m8olrf/why_rkt_is_not_just_a_mortgage_company_with_an_app/","title":"Why RKT is not just a mortgage company with an app","author":"CMScientist","firstseen":"2021-03-24 21:45:32.757114"}

A company in Texas where it was unexpectedly cold for a little while. Actually, more specifically, Vistra Energy is an energy producer and provider, serving millions in dozens of states. This is done both via wholesale power sales or its retail segment. Even amongst other energy gorillas in the absolutely massive energy zoo, the firm is no small ape slinger; it is the largest competitive energy provider in the United States with over 39 GW of power generation in its portfolio ‚Äì a number capable of sending Marty back to the future to sleep with your wife 32x. It also rivals that of traditional utilities like Duke Energy or Southern Company.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fhp9400xu0o61.jpg?width=195&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=88c495202d872f2a32627086343335bec39b260e\n\n\"So what?\"\n\nBeginning this year, EBITDA over the next three years was expected to be in excess of $9,000mm, of which the firm would have converted 60% of that to free cash flow. While some of that was set to fund growth projects (investments in renewables), the bulk of it was going to be returned to shareholders in the form of either dividends or shareholder buybacks. The firm was coming off of a multi-year deleveraging cycle and had achieved the leverage metrics necessary to qualify for investment grade credit, meaning that the heavy lifting on the balance sheet was done and it was time for the equity to benefit. The market, for various reasons, was fundamentally mispricing this opportunity. Vistra Energy traded with free cash flow yields to the equity in excess of 20%, and even traded with double digit annual free cash flow yields on the entire enterprise.\n\nVistra was doing well. Really well. Then came this once in a lifetime storm. Investors thought, \"no big deal. They can weather this thing.\" But then the management peeps disclosed a forecast of $900 ‚Äì 1,300mm in the aftermath of the freeze. In addition, media reported wiffs of bankruptcies across these companies.  BOOM! Sell-off.\n\nBut what happened? and is Vistra really in danger? Well, lots of  things happened that my smooth brain doesn't entirely comprehend, but it turns out it was an ERCOT pricing error outside their control. They were really well prepared to deal with this if it weren't for some stupid incompetent bureaucracy.\n\nVistra did good before the storm. They predicted the weather event and spent money to be ready. In fact, they were more ready than your wife's BF when you're in the taxi on the way to the airport for a business trip. Before the storm, they locked up natural gas supplies. They were prepped to be supplying energy in the face of this severe catastrophe.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/csq9qfb6v0o61.jpg?width=259&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a491d2fcb5ffbb9699dc88a454f868f4c0957a2a\n\nThe winter storm comes and the grid gets shut down. Other fake and inefficient energy production like wind and solar go offline.\n\nThrough all of this drama, Vistra Energy is supplying a large portion of the power of the grid as one of the few electricity providers that was prepared. Yet, inexplicably, the ERCOT mandated price was slow to respond to conditions. Even with half of Texas power generation offline and load demand near all-time winter highs, market prices were not where they should have been.\n\nFor perspective, stated prices fell from $9,000 per MWh initially to as little as $1,500 per MWh by mid-day Monday on February 15. Vistra Energy went into this crisis substantially long and ready to fulfill its role, but prices were marked to market too low when load was shed, meaning they were supplying the bulk of early grid electricity at weaker rates. Further, ERCOT mandated blackouts did not occur in areas where they had energy, a situation that helped other electricity providers that could sell during downtime.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5d4i1f9uv0o61.jpg?width=313&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6a395faf7d9b7b4538820b63a704ddf9fe904758\n\nUltimately Biff ended up with Marty's mom, Marty doesn't get to the clock tower and Vistra get's screwed.\n\nStated prices fell from $9,000 per MWh initially to as little as $1,500 per MWh by mid-day Monday on February 15. Vistra Energy went into this crisis substantially long and ready to fulfill its role, but prices were marked to market too low when load was shed, meaning they were supplying the bulk of early grid electricity at weaker rates. Further, ERCOT mandated blackouts did not occur in areas where they had energy, a situation that helped other electricity providers that could sell during downtime.\n\nEnd of the day, despite making the correct weather call, the firm ended up with a higher cost of goods mix than it anticipated (higher natural gas prices, less use of coal-fired generation) and pricing issues related to the Monday morning ERCOT issue.\n\n**Longstory Short**Vistra is positioned to üöÄüåï. Afterall, we know that Marty & Doc always save the day.

Minor pullbacks expected as wave (1) of (iii) completes between $286 and $322. Breaking resistance at 231.02 confirms upside. Holding above support keeps further downside as alternate count.\n\nResistance (wave i): 231.02\n\nMajor Support (wave 4): 172.50 \n\nMinor Support (wave ii): 183.58\n\n**Discussion**\n\nAfter watching GME pullback in corrective fashion in overlapping waves finally completing at 183.58 today, wave 1 of iii took off, and completed five waves quickly (which we would expect in a 3rd wave such as iii), extending beyond the standard .618 extension of i from ii, nearly hitting the .764 extension before turning down at 227. This completes 1 of iii of (1) of (iii). We now wait to see how far 2 retraces 1, and from 2 we can more accurately calculate these minute subwaves. However, with 1 extending beyond a standard fib target, each subsequent wave should also be lifted by the same number of fibs surpassed. In lifting these targets, we have the following regions: 3 \\~ 264; iii \\~286; (i) between 286 and 382.\n\n**Conclusion:** As long as the minor support holds, we have room to run. Only a break of 183.58 forces us to consider today's upside as a new b wave of an incomplete ii. A break of 172.5 forces us to consider that the large green 4 has not yet completed. Alt yellow count remains, but as long as new supports are developed and held, we shouldn't worry about that for now.

Averaging down with FB profits (FB WAS A BEAST) makes me feel better but I‚Äôm not too confident in AH action. \n\nWill see if GM makes a statement or something \n\n****\n\n**Pre-close/ AH 3/22**\n\nTake a look [shit happening tomorrow](https://www.spotrambo.com/), a lot of events. I‚Äôm intrigued by INTC even though my chip prediction already ran heavy. \n\nMy faith in GM may pay off. Looks like the culprit was chip shortage issues this morning‚Äî could‚Äôve been smooth without that wrench. \n\nDOCU FINALLY waking up heading into their Wednesday RAMBO, I want more though from them considering NASDAQ‚Äôs roaring today\n\n****\n\n**3/22 GM event update**\n\nI liked it and the market is warming up‚Äî lots of talk about partnership and even battery customization. With the event on Thursday and intraday action slowly turning around, I‚Äôm still bullish and will hold. Particularly because my average down paid off well. \n\n**3/22 9 am update**\n\nTaking some of my considerable FB profits to average down (more) on GM\n\n**3/22 AM UPDATE**\n\nFine and pleased with everything else, but seeing no real reason for the GM dump no matter what I search. \n\nIf they don‚Äôt announce a partnership with TSLA or something in the next hour my gf is gonna fucking kill me when she wakes up...as we pack for the shelter. üò≠ \n\n**3/21 Weekend Update**\n\n1) **Noticed**: a lot of activity on PTON I noticed while reviewing Friday (wrote this week on Thursday)\n\n2) **GM**: they added two more events in the next like 8 days to their investor relations page. These and other events for the week have been thrown up on the new look spotrambo.com\n\n3) **don‚Äôt just dive in to stuff** at open tomorrow if you‚Äôre not feeling it, could be a weird week. An hour wait rule. \n\n**One more 3/19 Update:**\n\nPeople are asking what I mean when I say RAMBO. I created www.spotrambo.com (with the help of my new BFF üß†) which has a decent explainer and I‚Äôll be putting some more up over the weekend, and a big batch Sunday. \n\n**Update 3/19 mid day:**\n\nForgot I keep seeing crazy OTM calls for PENN. [This one just came through today in fact](https://i.imgur.com/tTtzJNh.jpg) \n\n****\n\nI realized the entire problem with last week's edition was that I forgot the fucking rocket emojis.  Never again. üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ \n\nDoing this one early because your boy is heated.  To be fair, I **was pretty explicit about having low confidence in plays this week due to FOMC flukiness**--and that this was probably the closest I come to sitting shit out without sitting shit out--but still disappointed.  I don't like to let the people down!\n\n**Word of caution**üêª : Next week is **post-quad witching**, a historically volatile week for stocks.  For that reason I am still bagholding some VXX, choosing entries with caution, and keeping plenty of dry powder.  I don't care what Jerome says about inflation, this is not face-first YOLO time.\n\n****\n\n**Last week‚Äôs baggers:** Although the Tier 1 beating got most of the attention, **GPRO CS DB AAPL** all printed.  **VXX** on a ventilator but still (barely) in the game as of this writing.\n\n**Last week‚Äôs lessons:** VIX is too unpredictable--SPY puts are the way if you have a bearish sentiment.  Also, **if you have as little confidence as I said I had last week, just sit it out**--there's no shame in kicking back. \n\n****\n\n**Plays with RAMBO**\n\n[GM](https://i.imgur.com/pLLrckZ.jpg) & 3/22 [Conference Event](https://i.imgur.com/Y8i7aE7.jpg) üöÄ üöÄ \n\nSUPER consistent OTM call buying over the past two weeks.  Unsure if this RAMBO on Monday is necessarily THE catalyst but it's worth finding out.  Either way, you're rolling with a ticker that has seen some of the most frenzied UOA for a boomer stock this quarter.  It couldn't hold above 60 after the first run, so anything lower than that may be worth getting in to see if it crosses and if 60 becomes support after the event Monday.\n\nBUT WAIT! [There‚Äôs more....](https://i.imgur.com/zTXu6MU.jpg)\n\n[DOCU](https://i.imgur.com/SWtoqGP.jpg) üöÄ üöÄ \n\nDOCU has an investor day coming up with that peculiar post-ER timing that screams \"pump\".  They've really slid since ER, and are floating around that nice, easy benchmark 200 number.  Look to grab if it touches or dips below, and hold through the RAMBO.  This got me on board:\n\n>Consider this: 18 of the top 20 global pharmaceutical companies, 10 of the top 15 global financial services companies and seven of the top 10 global tech companies all utilize DocuSign‚Äôs technology. In addition, 800 federal, state and local government agencies utilize the company‚Äôs platform.\n\nImagine them talking about that kinda shit for hours on end during an INVESTOR DAY.  Yum.\n\nüêª: there is put buying around DOCU right now, could be hedging, could likely be during this week‚Äôs sell offs people dropped, but it‚Äôs there and subject to interpretation \n\n****\n\n**Play, non-RAMBO**\n\n[FB](https://i.imgur.com/Yn7IHJh.jpg) üöÄ üöÄ \nThese two intriguing FB bets stood out to me as more than coincidental or tech flow.  Short dated, significantly outside the money, and one of them on the ask-side (a bullish sign).  I'm going to keep an eye on tech flow to ensure I like it, then probably test out a 4/9 290.  [Also, Zuckerberg is talking shit now like iOS priacy updates won't be the death of him.](https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2021/03/18/zuckerberg-facebook-may-be-in-stronger-position-after-apple-ios-14.html)\n\n****\n\n**Repeated call buying on both Unusual Whales and Unusual Options Activity that mean something to me but aren‚Äôt quite Tier 1:**\n\n[VIAC](https://i.imgur.com/6Qw7H1r.jpg) üöÄ \n[CCJ](https://i.imgur.com/cRfL0e8.jpg) üöÄ \n\nLots of bearish hedge activity on each of these too, which can be a good sign, but also may mean the expected catalyst is fragile. \n\n****\n\n**Sector trends in whale bets/UOA I‚Äôve picked up that mean something to me:**\n\n1) **Chips**: It could be SEMICON, but all chip manufacturers are beginning to have more and more otm bets placed on them.  Chip shortage bla bla, but it could be time for them to make another run after getting snuffed out the past few times.\n\n[AMD](https://i.imgur.com/hvbe8gi.jpg) [MU](https://i.imgur.com/1lEpm6e.jpg) [AMAT](https://i.imgur.com/u7oUKbg.jpg) [INTC](https://i.imgur.com/auM5FBs.jpg) \n\n**2) Steel and stuff**: Lots of activity around both [X](https://i.imgur.com/MzjfGZE.jpg) and [FCX](https://i.imgur.com/ywSP4kW.jpg) (including this X UOA way OTM), among other materials.  I'd venture that infrastructure is about to become a crucial frontier in the post-stimmy administration and now is the time to hop in.  I may follow some UOA on the X monthly, 30c.\n\n****\n\n**TLDR**: GM DOCU FB/ VIAC CCJ / CHIPS,  INFRASTRUCTURE. \n\nHappy Hunting. Happy Friday.

TL;DR\n2. Purpose\n3. Investing in Internet Forums\n4. Searching\n5. Software Design \n6. Summary\n\n# TL;DR\n\nFB is the mall. PINS is Costco. Google+ created the wrong product.  \n\n\nPinterest 100B Marketcap by 2023. Think about who the customers are, what they‚Äôre doing, and why they do it.\n\n# Purpose\n\nSome of you folk may remember the DD I wrote about Cloudflare and serverless computing back in May 2020, but most of those posts were written far less seriously and lacked professionalism. To be frank, I was surprised by the hunger for knowledge and I really enjoyed debating some of the rather brazen people here.\n\nWSB has grown and in my view, our committed analysts tend to BTFO Wall Street analysts. We have on-the-ground experience as laborers, customers, and digital-natives that they often filter out of a privileged ignorance.\n\nPart of this is also due to the fact that I believe that investing in securities will become increasingly complex yet accessible for a typical retail investor which will either result in isolation OR incentivize cooperation.\n\n* Does the average retail investor really understand the core regulatory influences in investments like Square, PayPal, or even rob-the-hood? **(DD Complete)**\n* Are we familiar with new international trades that increase Mexican-Texan manufacturing? **(DD in Draft Mode)**\n* Is the average retail investor familiar with the network models that govern software like Fastly and Twilio? (**Fastly DD in Progress)**\n* Do we understand incentives vs. bias? **(Roblox DD in Progress)**\n* How knowledgable are we of fashion trends that make Nike and Foot Locker valuable?\n* Is an average retail investor familiar with competitive types of manufacturing processes when they invest in technologies like AMD or GE?\n\nAt the end of the day, I am an educator and I believe that the goal of education is to engage a reader into a deeper curiosity or discussion, so that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm sharing my writing. I‚Äôm not here to convince you that this stock is even a good choice - but to explore the economics behind it.\n\n## Investing in Internet Forums\n\nLet‚Äôs keep one question in mind:\n\n>Did Facebook‚Äôs implementation of a hashtag kill Twitter?\n\nUltimately, what drives a social-networking site is a user‚Äôs incentive to search and discover information in that particular forum. As a result, examining social-networking sites can be a lot like comparing shopping centers, such that a shopper is incentivized to go to a location for a particular reason that is served by that institution. Pinterest uses pins, Reddit uses subreddits, and Google uses links - all having unique advantages as a means to distribute information.\n\n[Pinterest-as-a-Search-Service](https://preview.redd.it/are6a4e5hxn61.png?width=1780&format=png&auto=webp&s=a547a926696fc0a7cc5fb3f7bdcaf78be4f7d684)\n\nThe forum may take on a different medium, but it is ultimately a forum none the less. If we try to categorize it roughly, the forums would look like this:\n\n* Google is fueled by user‚Äôs need for answered information.\n* Facebook is fueled by a user‚Äôs need to connect.\n* Pinterest is fueled by a user‚Äôs need for ideas.\n* Reddit is fueled by a user‚Äôs need for community.\n* Online video games are fueled by a user‚Äôs need for adventure.\n\n[The power of incentives](https://preview.redd.it/j4hi9w0ghxn61.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&s=cf7e4a2b9b600fa25459c8b19f9f433f47df30ae)\n\nWith this basic model, you can argue which forum may be inelastic. In my view, it ranks like this, where the top rank is the most inelastic due to human behavior:\n\n1. Google (need for information)\n2. Games (need for adventure)\n3. Reddit (need for community)\n4. Pinterest (need for ideas)\n5. Facebook (need to connect)\n\nThe reason I rank Facebook as the most elastic version is because I have already witnessed multiple transformations resulting in users connecting in various ways in an attention-economy (Myspace, Twitter, Discord, TikTok, Roblox). I eventually expect this to replicate in other nations too. I also believe that people really underestimate how quickly humans find new ways to connect and can move to another platform for connection; which is quite a common occurrence in online gaming. I also believe that its physical network advantage is growing thinner.\n\n[Instagram entered Shops to compete with Pinterest, not Amazon.](https://preview.redd.it/wku6q9wnhxn61.png?width=1332&format=png&auto=webp&s=110e6225ab342e071fff9f9afe3cca5dee781cb3)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Take some time to think about why this relationship exists.](https://preview.redd.it/n88by55cjxn61.jpg?width=550&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=daf1792d80d438e61da83bf2bdef5ff55bdb4627)\n\n## Searching\n\nConsider this economic relationship.\n\n>What are the demographics of male underwear shoppers and who do male underwear brands market to? Women. Why?\n\nThat being said, I think Pinterest is wonderfully positioned and has quite an interesting history. The network-effect that built Pinterest was mostly driven by women, which has profound economic consequences across global households. What this ultimately results in product education, where families learn how to use Pinterest as a tool and search engine for ideas, rather than a local-friendgroup site. As a result, Pinterest‚Äôs recommendation model is geared to advertise to women-influenced **interests**, which we will touch on shortly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[An incredible economic relationship occurring at global scale.](https://preview.redd.it/6gz07fu6ixn61.png?width=1936&format=png&auto=webp&s=5e467e4dc0ab9725cdd935c3eafe82495b7f487f)\n\nThis has long-term positive consequences for product messengers regardless of culture. You can try it yourself to understand; it feels like what you want Google Images to do for you at times:\n\n\\- Recipe, Exercise, and Diet ideas (Peloton)\n\n\\- Birthday gift ideas (Michaels, Corsair)\n\n\\- Skincare ideas (Target, Hims & Hers)\n\n\\- Tips for traveling to another area (AirBnB)\n\n\\- Home construction (Sherwin-Williams, James hardie)\n\n\\- Omnichannel support from places like TikTok, Zoom, Etsy\n\n[Corsair Setup Ideas: note links to Wayfair and Reddit.](https://preview.redd.it/h3sro1lpixn61.png?width=3781&format=png&auto=webp&s=6c76e8fc0d837b2cc8f174d31a771e587dd1f0ef)\n\n[House Interior Paint: note links to BERH, Sherwin-Williams, Etsy, and Pinterest Shops.](https://preview.redd.it/t0gff9gsixn61.png?width=3718&format=png&auto=webp&s=db6bebc0584c0be1ff75e08fbd79c6ca3ba6f169)\n\nThe fact is, it‚Äôs the user who is actually voluntarily searching for ads in an ad space. Behaviorally, this means that Pinterest‚Äôs users are in a ‚Äúhigh willingness to engage‚Äù with things that result in ‚Äúaction‚Äù. **That is, a Pinterest user is logging in because they need to start something or they need to plan for something in the near future. This is basically a sweet spot for advertisers, as they know they‚Äôre getting top real estate on BOTH Google and Pinterest as a result of their product design.**\n\n[Pinterest users have an incredibly high ‚Äúwillingness to engage‚Äù as a function of using the social platform as a useful tool above all else.](https://preview.redd.it/au1vvhl1ixn61.png?width=1158&format=png&auto=webp&s=84a149db0fd2a541da14c0b813b66b37ee661439)\n\nPinterest was not designed to make a user spend hours mindlessly scrolling for content. It was designed to make a sale and keep a customer happy *outside* of Pinterest. That is fundamentally different than Facebook‚Äôs connect-everything approach to social-networking.\n\n# The Design\n\nPinterest ranks high in Google‚Äôs results for specific reasons. Pinterest develops its own in-app browser that has particular consequences for:\n\n1. Security & Privacy\n2. High demand for high quality ad-messaging and visuals\n3. Vectors to user‚Äôs websites generated by hosts like Shopify, Walmart, or other omnichannels.\n4. Vectors for advertisers\n5. A browser that follows Progressive Web App standards\n\n[Progressing Web Standards](https://preview.redd.it/fitjijovixn61.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=2fca3cb23f577904e044b7ec996fdfd2bdb87cfc)\n\nThe combination of these design choices ranks it high in ‚ÄúGoogle‚Äôs algorithm‚Äù, while this search engine result increases its bar for ranking each year. This means that bigger organizations like Twitter, DDash, and Pinterest will enjoy the tailwinds of these priorities.\n\nWhy is Google doing this? Because they want high web standards as a global competitor. Part of the global competition is shaping the internet‚Äôs develop to consider people that have high latency connections since software can scale faster than some of the hardware that is available around the globe. The internet is ultimately ‚Äúaccess to information‚Äù, which is as scarce as ‚Äúaccess to clean water‚Äù around the globe. So it‚Äôs carefully considered in strong engineering communities. \n\n## Summary\n\nI totally love the fact that the network-effect behind Pinterest is built by women, but not necessarily for women. I am carefully monitoring the results of this network-effect as I believe that it will have long-term consequences on family life. I feel that this kind of product design will eventually create a deeper gravity for advertisers, where they know that Pinterest users are essentially sustainable top-dollar advertising spaces; as users are looking directly to consume as a result of their usage which is far different than other social-media platform strategies.\n\nI use Facebook and Instagram every day, resulting in nothing. I use Pinterest a few times a month at most. The difference is, every time I use Pinterest - I follow up or plan to follow up with some consumer behavior. That, to me, is incredible.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/98hlzna3jxn61.png?width=2595&format=png&auto=webp&s=b96810ee07ec792e76631486c2c6759308099648\n\n[https://res.cloudinary.com/eduprojectsil/image/upload/v1616136466/pinterestblogpost\\_s8hpxc.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/eduprojectsil/image/upload/v1616136466/pinterestblogpost_s8hpxc.png)","created_utc":"2021-03-19 11:11:26","num_comments":48,"score":112,"upvote_ratio":0.9,"is_original_content":false,"permalink":"/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m8jd87/understanding_social_networks_pinterests_idea/","title":"Understanding Social Networks: Pinterest‚Äôs Idea Search Engine, Women‚Äôs Influence, and What Google+ Got Wrong. $PINS DD.","author":"notbrokemexican","firstseen":"2021-03-24 21:45:32.766635"}

That's it, its a product company.\n\nThe value proposition is straightforward: they offer a comprehensive platform to do AI from data collection to training models to deployment.\n\nNothing like this exists on the market.\n\nThey truly invent the Enterprise AI concept or at least the market will look at them that way.\n\nLarge organizations WILL buy into this stuff as they value having certified people (whatever that means) as they have on SAP, Oracle, AWS, GCP, whatever.\n\nLarge organizations don't want to hire engineers unless engineering is their core business. They want guys with very well defined certifications. Like it or not, that's the world we live in.\n\n[C3.ai](https://C3.ai) replaces all the opensource tech stack you need to do ML with a single, well qualified, vendor-supported platform.\n\nIf you wonder why large organizations use Oracle databases rather than MySql, you also understand why this will be BIG.\n\n[C3.ai](https://C3.ai) is delivering tangible business outcomes for its customers [https://c3.ai/customers/](https://c3.ai/customers/), and it is doing so strategically by engaging with fewer of them, but with a wide breadth of scope to build their reputation.\n\nTalking about the strategic outlook, you should look on LinkedIn for the academic and professional background of the people they hire: from the leadership team to the developers, they are investing massively in talent.\n\n57% of their staff has advanced degrees, most of them from the world's most prestigious universities, and many come from companies like McKinsey and Google.\n\nThe leadership team is super strong. You don't generally see that in a startup. I get the boomers' company comments being made, but as AI moves from recognizing cats to increase the efficiency of operations in Fortune 500, clients will value experience, industry knowledge, and all sort of stuff that these boomers have to offer.\n\nThe competition for [C3.ai](https://C3.ai) will come from GCP, AWS and Azure as they also start offering end-to-end data platform rather than other companies like Palantir. Having seen GCP, I would say that there is where competition is going to be.

{"_id":{"$oid":"605bb2fc5df7eedfb49c1ee7"},"id":"m8inij","fullname":"t3_m8inij","selftext":"Hi all, NrdRage  here. Just FYI, today's DD was going to be $RKUNY, but they had a  massive pop earlier this week, and the trade is no longer interesting in  the short term.  Then I thought $VWAGY, but the same thing happened on Wednesday. So instead, I give you this flaming bag of dogshit  instead.\n\nWhat if I told you that you had the opportunity to invest in a company that has been around since 1906.  And what if I told you that this company, which has been around for 115  years, loses spectacularly large amounts of money - in fact, only  having positive earnings in two quarters since 2018? Oh, and they make  amazingly bad products which are shockingly unreliable, to boot?  Products that you can't afford and will never own? And that they've  diluted themselves to 8.37 BILLION shares of stock, absolutely none of  which is really held by company insiders who have an opportunity to bet  on themselves? Pretty amazing, right?\n\nLet's talk about Rolls-Royce ($RYCEY), cause you're probably gonna buy some by the time this is over.\n\n# Let's get this shitshow started, shall we?\n\nSo  all of you know them from their ridiculously expensive vehicles, which I  wouldn't take over a Honda if the trip mattered because they break down  so often. But consumer automotives  isn't really where they \"make\" their money - to use the term very  loosely. As a matter of fact, this company doesn't even make those  pieces of shit anymore - BMW does. No, these fucktards have 4 different  divisions: Civil aeronautics (50% of their revenue), Defense systems  (25%), marine and aeronautic power systems (20%), and IT-pee aeronautics  (uhhhh, math for smoothbrain).  In short, they're a defense contractor who also bolts on pretty  unreliable engines onto passenger jets to try and get you to Vegas as  you try to spend 2 days pretending  you're not some basic bitch who's gone from raging against the machine  to raging against the washing machine. Except you're not nearly as hot  as Stacy's mom.\n\n# Pretend  I'm saying shit about their story and any unique aspects about them or  that anything they do is remotely interesting here. They don't, so I'm  not going to try to make it happen, but usually this is where I put  that. Moving on....\n\n# Looking under the hood...or inside the cowling, as it were.\n\nThe  financials of this company are, frankly, abominably bad. They lost over  7 billion dollars last year. They operate at a negative-40% profit  margin. They have less than 5 billion dollars in the bank. In the immortal words of Spose, this company has the swagger of a cripple.  Demand for  jet engines completely dried up by the time Nancy Pelosi was trying to  get you to go to Chinatown to celebrate Chairman Mao during CNY last  year, and it only got worse the longer this whole virus thing dragged  on. No flights not only means  no planes and no demand for engines but, more importantly, no demand  for expensive maintenance contracts to keep those engines from blowing  up. 50% of their revenue comes from consumer air travel. Their forward guidance was some of the worst damp-handed beta cuckery I've heard in a long time.  They've already  come out and said they'll be LUCKY if they generate 50% of the revenue  they generated pre pandemic even after we get back to normal because of  the obliteration of business travel. They've diluted themselves into  oblivion, so they have to borrow money rather than raise it. And  countries not named United States of America have largely decided to  make up for their deficits in revenue as a result of completely  obliterating their economies by reducing spend in the military space, so  the Royal Navy ain't  exactly buying a bunch of their engines, either. The only thing less  sexy about this company is your wife in a negligee. Seriously, I get  that even ugly girls need love, but can't you put a bag over her head or  something? And one for your whole body too, you fat fuck. Oh, and did I  mention that they make mostly widebody engines in a world in which most  airplanes are going narrow body? So there's that.\n\nMore  importantly, even though the vast majority of the industry of the world  has kind of recovered their stock prices, RYCEY is presently at a  whopping $1.76, down from their pre-virus highs of about 12.50\n\n# This is a joke, right? You're fucking clowning us to see how much you can get away with, aren't you you sick fuck?\n\nNot  even remotely a joke. I mean, you are a clown, but I'm not clowning  you. I'm dead serious. Buying this company is a good idea.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause  the saving grace their shitty products have is that their competition  ($GE, Pratt & Whitney - aka $RTX) make an even SHITTIER product.  P&W, in particular, has gotten under the microscope recently because  the 4077 engines they slapped on UAL's 777's started falling apart.  Remember this?\n\n[Look out below!](https://preview.redd.it/7m9slpqjwzn61.jpg?width=301&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ca799f0bbb649cf9c5b4448e52fe935994d35292)\n\n$RYCEY  might be able to start putting their products on those beasts. $GE  slaps a GE90 on that same plane and, though thankfully none of those  have exploded yet (well, I mean, except for that one that got shot with a  rocket near Russia...but I digress...well, and I'm sure that Malaysian one that is chilling with Amelia Earhart probably exploded on impact), they're a maintenance headache.  On and on down the line we go, they've all got their quirks. Rolls, for  their credit, hangs its hat on their Trent 1000 engine, which is what  keeps the Dreamliners  in the air. Course, they're famous for fatigue cracking and have to be  inspected every 80 flights (down from an average of about 200 for the  industry) because they're so unreliable. Their one home run engine got  slapped on the A380, and then that whole plane got canceled like it had made an at-the-time milquetoast insensitive Tweet 15 years ago even though  it's the best bird in the sky.\n\nThis  is all a long way of saying they all have issues, but RR has slightly  fewer issues. Thankfully for them, airlines, not wanting to be sued, are  willing to pay up lots of money for service agreements, and that makes  up an insane amount of their revenue. You know, when the planes are  flying. One positive thing they have going for them is the A350 is going  to exclusively be using their engines, so they've got that going for  them. Matter of fact, they just recently locked down an exclusive  agreement to be the provider of that bird's engines until 2030 at the  earliest, which is a huge win. Plus it gives them time to figure out why their Ultrafan engines (which are supposed to replace the Trents) are such miserable piles of garbage.\n\n# So why are they a good investment (and price targets)?\n\nWell,  in practicality, they're not really, but in a market that is strongly  indicating it's way overbought, this is one of the very few companies  that hasn't had its turn at the recovery wheel on the stonk markets. With a 52 week  low of 1.31, they're presently only sitting about 40 cents off that  mark, and most of that has happened in the last couple of weeks. We've  seen the airline stocks start to fly recently, and $BA has been on an  absolute tear, so logically speaking, $RYCEY is kind of next soyboy up. Quick, name 5 stocks trading anywhere near their 52 week lows? Do I think they're going to get back to their pre-virus valuation of 12-16 a share? Fuuuuuck  no. They're really badly managed and air travel is forever changed,  which is going to really put a dent in their forward revenues\n\nBUT....there's  not a doubt in my mind that they're going to see $3.40 in the VERY near future, $4 in the slightly near future and I would be positively shocked if they aren't at 8 by the end  of the year, which means you can catch a 4-bagger on these guys while  you laugh about how the absolute worst company in your portfolio is, on a  share basis, one of your best performers. Because laughing about that  is easier than crying about how your wife's boyfriend recently informed  you that he was upgrading to a 3.\n\nStupidly, my price targets are actually below that of most analysts, and those guys always undersell.\n\n# Technical analysis:\n\nThere  is none! All my charts were for $RKUNY, and I'm not going to spend 20  minutes creating charts showing this thing's price action, especially  since the charts are ugly as fuck due to the fact that the stock only  moves in increments of fractional pennies in spite of having a 14 billion dollar market cap.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOK ok, ONE chart.  This is a daily going back to last July.  Teal is the XMA and the dark blue line is the SMA. The nude line is a 200 SMA and not relevant to this discussion.  You can see it recovered a little (off chart) and then when \"wave 2\" hit, fell off a cliff again, and then gapped down hard at the end of November.  Since that point, it has largely been consolidating, but has tested the 1.31 low no fewer than 10 times, holding that support each time.  Since mid February, it's been on a slow but steady climb to fill that gap created in November at 3.40.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ba4ts33xwzn61.jpg?width=1461&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4d376790877057d56fd2b0e97380d3acd39083a6\n\n# How do you play it?\n\nSimple: SHARES! It's the only way you CAN play it, because there's no options chain for this dog.\n\nYa  know, the longer I write this, the more it seems like I'm kind of  phoning this one in, but given the subject matter, I think that's  entirely appropriate. If you're asking yourself why, well, this one is  about to start making its climb upwards as more people start packing  into planes. Plus, until this whole Gamestop thing is over with, those fucking apes keep downvoting anything that's not Gamestop.\n\n# So, to summarize:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Shitty company....\n* with even shittier competitors\n* Didn't get to take part in the economic recovery in the markets; still trading a lot closer to 52 week lows than highs\n* Has some guaranteed gubmint money, and is doing Playstation-like exclusives with certain planes for their engines\n* Shares only\n* Gives you the bragging rights of saying you're such a good investor that you made money on the dollar general of the Aerospace world\n\n# Position Disclaimers:\n\n\\-500,000  shares at $1.72. Up until very recently, I was actually underwater on  this one (Edit:  As of this morning, I'm flat on it again). It dropped 11 cents yesterday and that was actually  significant enough to where it put a huge dent in the price. I have  absolutely no intention of buying more. This position represents less  than 1% of my fun money portfolio, so I'm not terribly interested in it,  but I know it's going to make me money, and that's all I care about.\n\nAll my love\n\n\\-Chad Dickens","created_utc":"2021-03-19 10:38:19","num_comments":160,"score":377,"upvote_ratio":0.94,"is_original_content":false,"permalink":"/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m8inij/nrdrages_friday_dd_the_absolute_shittiest_company/","title":"NrdRage's Friday DD: The absolute shittiest company I'll review.

It doesn‚Äôt own stocks, so it is not affected by the wall street‚Äôs sentiment or noise. It follows actual rates, so, for someone who believes that rates are going higher, BDRY offers that simple pure exposure. If you believe that dry bulk shipping freight rates are going to increase then this is the only public investment vehicle available to buy. And the beauty of it? -> as an ETF you can always short it if you believe shipping rates are going to fall.!\n\nBDRY is listed on NYSE and is the first and only freight futures ETF exclusively focusing on dry bulk shipping. A pure-play exposure to dry bulk shipping, an instrumental part of the global commodity market, uncorrelated to other major assets.\n\nBDRY is designed to reflect the daily price movements of the near-dated dry bulk freight futures. It offers investors unlevered exposure to dry bulk freight without the need for a futures account. It provides transparency to investors by listing all its holdings daily. It is designed to reduce the effects of rolling contracts by using a laddered strategy to buy contracts while letting existing positions expire and settle in cash.\n\nWhat‚Äôs the Investment Strategy behind? BDRY will hold freight futures with a weighted average of approximately three months to expiration. It intends to progressively increase its position to the next calendar quarter three-month strip while existing positions are maintained and settle in cash. The allocation is 50% Capesize contracts, 40% Panamax contracts and 10% Supramax contracts, rebalancing annually, as needed.\n\nIn my opinion, BDRY is the best way to capture the dry bulk shipping opportunity. What most people do is to buy shipping stocks. But is this the most efficient way? No, it‚Äôs not. Disadvantages of individual shipping stocks, other than liquidity, include company-specific risks, dilution risks as well as corporate governance and management issues. Finally, especially nowadays, it‚Äôs the broader equity market risk even though freight rates generally have exhibited low correlation to equity markets.\n\nBDRY is a very innovative product in the world of shipping, transforming every investor into a shipowner that rips the benefits of freight rates through a much simpler and efficient structure compared to shipowning.","created_utc":"2021-03-19 09:18:42","num_comments":17,"score":0,"upvote_ratio":0.31,"is_original_content":true,"permalink":"/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m8h2ki/bdry_is_up_more_than_140_this_year/","title":"$BDRY is up more than 140% this year","author":"NorthSails21","firstseen":"2021-03-24 21:45:32.772952"}

KGaA (FME.DE)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/FME.DE)    \nprice per share today (19 Mar 12 UTC) 61.58‚Ç¨ = 73.35$\n\n‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê\n\nWhat's it all about? **Fresenius Medical Care** is active worldwide in its own blood dialysis clinics. In short, if you've drunk too much varnish again, they wash the shit out of you. This happens in about 4000 clinics on (almost) all continents. The business is basically solid, crises have little impact because people keep fucking their health. The dividends are nothing earth-shattering but okay and were even increased this year. The parent company Fresenius is a stable global player and keeps making nice acquisitions and has good prospects.\n\n**Why is it interesting? There were two dips last month in best Felix Baumgartner fashion.**\n\n**Dip No. 1:** Because of Covid 19, business is a little worse because some treatments can't be done. Oh scare. The first part of the exploders shits themselves and liquidates the entire depot. Stock crashes from 65‚Ç¨ to 56‚Ç¨. Then people notice that Corona goes around at some point and maybe that wasn't so smart, so the thing flies back up to 62‚Ç¨.\n\n**Dip No. 2:** The numbers have been released! For Q4 2020, the experts expect 4.49 billion in revenue, but it's actually only 4.40 billion. A whole 4% less in a massive pandemic crisis, what a scandal! The last hard boiled boomer break out in tears now and like in panic the entire depot is liquidated like piss. Two boomers have been hit particularly hard: [Doc Olaf and Harald](https://www.finanzen.net/insidertrades/fresenius_medical_care), two CEOs of FME. They were so shocked by the figures that they accidentally treated themselves to a total of 5000 stonks. Could it be that, as CEOs, they know more when they put their money where their mouth is? Or have they simply sniffed too many sharpies? Certainly the latter!\n\nThe [P/E ratio](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/FMS/fresenius-medical-care-ag-kgaa/pe-ratio) is decent compared to the company's past history and to other companies in the sector. There is restructuring and reasonable long-term planning at both FME and Fresenius. Two CEOs are flanking in nicely. Signs are that it is undervalued and a bargain.\n\nI don't expect too much in the short term. If the news is particularly good, the stock could climb back up to ‚Ç¨65. But by the end of 2021 or early 2022 at the latest, it should be back at ‚Ç¨70 and higher. After all, this is blood dialysis, which will always be running, and not cars with screwed-up airbags, of which you first have to recall 20 million. In 20 years, when you're hooked up to an FME machine and die because you drank and smoked too much, you'll be nostalgic for the zarties this place made you. Diamond hands and perseverance prove!\n\n**Risks**\n\n**FME is of course attached to Fresenius**. One drawback is that Fresenius works a lot with credit and has a lot of debt, which is not a problem so far because of the turnover and the percentages, but if the credit conditions were to deteriorate, the business would also look worse. Overall, Fresenius is more broadly positioned and also includes FME shares, so if you want to play it a little safer, put some money in there.\n\nIn addition, Fresenius makes a number of takeovers and it is always possible that one will go to shit and fuck up the business. All that would of course affect FME as well. But I think even in the worst case the long-term strategy and outlook are right, so you would be condemned to hold the bag for a while but not have a total loss.\n\nSince this DD has been written, FMC has climbed from 58.18‚Ç¨ to 61.64‚Ç¨ (about +6%) and was relatively unimpressed by all the corrections. Could perhaps be due to the fact that the boomers have already beaten the thing so much that there was nothing left to kick and spit on. Chapeau! This development and the fat insider buying at that time confirm my assumption that FMC was strongly undervalued (see DD). FMC still has a P/E ratio of 15.05 and now there was another fat insider trade of 600k$ last week and another 300k$ last month.\n\nNo investment advice, I drink more varnish than you do bleach. Do your own research and form your own opinion!\n\n***Notice:*** *I own 100 shares*\n\nEdit: Part of the DD (\"Risks\") drifted into the nether, fixed this.","created_utc":"2021-03-19 08:03:39","num_comments":10,"score":20,"upvote_ratio":0.67,"is_original_content":false,"permalink":"/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m8fqeu/fresenius_medical_care_fmede_undervalued_company/","title":"Fresenius Medical Care: $FME.DE - undervalued company with three fat insider trades","author":"QuastQuan","firstseen":"2021-03-24 21:45:32.774993"}

When covid happened, my stock portfolio took a major hit along with the market, but it wasn't as bad as it could've been. I started to look for the companies that got hit hard by the pandemic, but would bounce back stronger once the country opened back up. I immediately had movie theaters in mind for some sweet investment potential.\n\nIn the past year, CNK hit a low of $5.71 and AMC went down to $1.91 and I had to pick which horse to bet on. I opted to go all in on CNK because they were in a better financial situation, and maybe I was biased from having worked there, but it made the most sense to me until all of this came about.\n\nAs AMC climbed up to around $20 during that initial wave, my CNK went up by association, I sold, and then I turned my attention towards GME midway through the first climb and made a quick profit. Afterwards, I returned to my original movie theater plan, only this time, I was all in on AMC.\n\nIn my opinion, AMC now has the highest return potential out of all the movie theater chains, even without the short squeeze.\n\nIn early 2015 and late 2016/early 2017, both Cinemark and AMC had record breaking years. CNK stock was 1.9x higher at around $45 and AMC was 2.5x higher at around $35. Business was booming, but it wasn't really because the theaters were doing anything different, it was because the studios released A TON of record breaking movies during that time, which brought in massive revenue for theaters.\n\n39 of the Top 50 highest grossing films were released in the last decade and 38 of those grossed over $1 billion in international box office revenue. With all the huge upcoming films, and the ones that got postponed from covid, and all the pent up demand to go to the movies, I am very confident that this trend will continue and that we'll see new record breaking films over the next few years and even the next decade.\n\nAnother concern that people were bringing up is that streaming services and VOD studio releases are going to kill movie theaters in the long run, and I think that this is completely wrong. As I just mentioned, 78% of the highest grossing films of all time came out in the last decade. While streaming services may have replaced brick and mortar video rental stores, they couldn't replace the experience of going to the movies and catching the latest film on the big screen and the increase in theater attendance over the last decade proves it.\n\nDuring AMC's Q4 conference call, the CEO mentioned that over half of their customers were return customers and that they were able to track this through their AMC Stubs memberships and from my time working for their competition, I can confirm that this was the same case over at Cinemark. We had dedicated return customers that would see a movie \\*at least\\* once a week, seniors especially. Those seniors fucking loved a discount day and they also just liked to get out of the house.\n\nWith the country opening back up, restrictions lifted, vaccines expected to be available for all adults by May, and 98% of AMC theaters to be open by tomorrow, that brings back the regulars which made up over half their business and everything is looking green in the months to come.\n\nI am 100% ALL IN on AMC and I have full confidence in the stock, but let's play devil's advocate:\n\nWorst case scenario, the big squeeze doesn't happen (it will), the company struggles to pay off it's debt while accruing more debt and then they start to go under, in which case, they will more than likely get acquisitioned by another company. Amazon, Netflix, or maybe one of their competitors, and then the shareholders see a nice payday. This scenario would take the longest to play out, which is the only major downside.\n\nRealistic Scenario, the big squeeze happens, \\*possibly\\* even breaking the quadruple digits, apes get tendies, the stock normalizes, and we have a party in the ruins of the hedgefunds that dared to bet against us.\n\nBest cast scenario, the big squeeze is fucking ridiculous, we all get super rich and buy condos on the moon.\n\nIn any case, the only way to make money on AMC is to buy and hold.\n\nAPES TOGETHER STRONG ü¶çüí™üöÄüåë","created_utc":"2021-03-19 06:43:32","num_comments":262,"score":1205,"upvote_ratio":0.82,"is_original_content":false,"permalink":"/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m8ei9r/why_amc_is_a_buy_an_employee_perspective/","title":"Why AMC is a BUY - An Employee Perspective","author":"RuinedXJosh","firstseen":"2021-03-24 21:45:32.775581"}

Did you notice how both these triangles end on a Friday, dipshits? Okay... let me tell you a story.\n\nIt's 2002. Young high-flying Kenny G coked up off his fabulously successful hedge fund Shitadel decided fuck-you money wasn't enough for him. So he set out to dominate the world of centralized finance and become a **Market Maker**. This was the start of **Shitadel Securities**, the company that now pays millions of dollars to laugh at what options you're buying on the toilet.\n\nAlmost immediately following its conception, Shitadel Securities takes off like a rocket. Around this time, MMs start quoting stock and option prices in penny increments instead of quarters, meaning MMs had to compete with each other by taking a risk on holding onto the right securities at the right time. And boy does Shitadel, **an options MM nonetheless,** have an appetite for risk. Shitadel Securities does so well that Kenny starts getting cocky and thinks he can turn Shitadel into an **Investment Bank**, the king of Chicago. But Wall Street smells his bullshit all the way from New York, and Kenny fails to penetrate the industry.\n\nDevastated. For the first time in Kenny's padded, cushiony life, he faces what still isn't real hardship. Too uncool for the club, it's at this point that Kenny decides to take out his insecurities (aha, get it?) on retail investors. Shitadel doubles down on something we are all now familiar with: **Payment for Order Flow**, a practice pioneered by none other than **Bernie Madoff**. E-Trade, TD Ameritrade, Charles Schwab, Ally Invest, First Trade, TradeStation,  Interactive Brokers Lite, and yes, Robinhood, all contract with Shitadel for PFOF. It's with a heavy heart that I tell you, **even Fidelity's options are routed to Shitadel under PFOF**.\n\nThis brings us to today with Shitadel Securities as the largest **internalizer** in finance. \"Oh for fucks sakes, what the hell is an *internalizer* now?\"\n\n[At least the SEC made a pretty little graphic for us, right?](https://preview.redd.it/zi54ada2jyn61.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=c35d47e4619234795a25b30a30a9c9a5af96167c)\n\nIn PFOF, your order is sent from whatever **discount brokerage** you're using to Shitadel Securities, who decides to either: A) pass your order onto the open market, where we like to watch a little green and red candles jump around or B) to take the other side of your order (short whatever you long, or long whatever you short) **at which point the life of your order ends, never making it to the open market**.\n\nYou heard me right. **When you use a discount brokerage like Robinhood, your order may never land on the open market.** But this is fine right?... Well let's imagine that there's only one monopolistic internalizer trading a security, and that internalizer is internalizing all the retail volume trying to buy a security. Even if millions of retail traders are buying the security, **the stock price on the open market wouldn't move, there would be no volume on the open market, and the internalizer would have a massive short position on the stock that they have to unload.** What this looks like in the world of green and red candles is a **massive bull flag while the internalizer is internalizing** and **massive upward breakouts when the internalizer unloads their short position**.\n\n*Okay, but in order for Shitadel to do this, they would need to be a monopoly, right?*\n\n[From https:\\/\\/www.citadelsecurities.com\\/products\\/equities-and-options\\/](https://preview.redd.it/e9dxgz1npyn61.png?width=1759&format=png&auto=webp&s=27801bbcd469eda01dc0e172a6bccb9de6c2e96b)\n\n*Okay, but if Shitadel were to do this, their smaller competitors would be able to gauge retail sentiment, even if retail volume is hidden from the exchange, and drive the price up before Shitadel, right?*\n\n[An obvious short attack. https:\\/\\/markets.businessinsider.com\\/news\\/stocks\\/gamestop-stock-price-trading-halts-volatility-spike-176-trading-range-2021-3-1030170445 ](https://preview.redd.it/ftjhzgexoyn61.png?width=1609&format=png&auto=webp&s=1883bbf2e32492ca9614c4ec57b3a19fe1ad705b)\n\n*Okay, okay. But why would Shitadel do this? Wouldn't it be so expensive for them in terms of* ***Impact Cost?***\n\nRemember how Shitadel Securities is an **options** MM? Notice how everyone's options lose a ton of money from the start to the end of these bull flags? Notice how the bull flags end on Fridays? It's my opinion that **Shitadel is spending millions of dollars on short attacks to make billions of dollars on your options expiring worthless.** A day like today is very dangerous for an internalizer doing this. If the price jumps out of their control, not only do they lose money on all their shorts, they also lose money on all their options. If enough people realize this and lay on the buy pressure, it can blow up in Shitadel's face and trigger the MOASS.\n\n# Boom.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\----- P.S. -----\n\nWant to know what the stochastic cucks call this? **Max Pain Theory.**\n\nWant to know my opinion on how to trades options on this?

Apparently they issued an ultimatum basically forcing brokers to choose between UWMC or RKT. UWMC is one of the largest if not the largest mortgage wholesaler in the country and RKT is quickly digging into the market share because they not only deal with brokers but also make a good portion of thier business being direct to consumer eliminating broker fees and passing the savings onto the customer. RKT made  the ultimatum public and thus there is a battle brewing between the two companies thus possibly taking a chunk of UWMCs customer base.\n\n\n\nEdit: Thanks for the gold!

Because of the unprecedented run up there is ITM strikes down to $1... There is at minimum 100,000 ITM options expiring this week, definitely more than that but I wasnt gonna sit down and get more than a rough count. As the year goes on a metric fuckton will continue unraveling. Obviously a lot of people will be exercising these options but a lot also will not, expecially the higher strikes. Combine this with the market turning into this kangaroo shit show especially with tech and a lot of people might just take the cash.\n\n\nI also cant help but think of the volume on calls once we get into mid year/once everyone found it it was free money to just buy tesla calls. I havent checked the chain but the OI has to be unprecedented in combination with mass groups of people discovering options and being locked at home.\n\n\nIm just some idiot but cant this potentially be a giant derisking event?\n\nEdit; just got bored and did next weeks expiring options up to $600. **There is 814,000 options expiring on 3/27 and thats rounding every number down so its actually more than that.

Alternate Count: lower pullback for Green ii ok (non-standard)... as long as price stays above 172.50 wave ii is alive and does not invalidate. Only a break of 172.50 would put a deeper green 4 on the table (even  of Alt Yellow). No downside targets as FUD uncalled for with bullish count primary.\n\n**Opinion (not advice)**\n\nToday opened with a small pullback to make a lower low for Green ii (2nd waves are excellent buying opportunities). This is within $1 of the perfect .618 retrace target. Additional pullback is still ok, as could technically pull all the way back to 172.50 without violating Elliott Wave.\n\nThe rally and minor pullback leave us safe for now looking to complete a i-ii-1-2. Continuing to rally and breaking resistance of yesterday's high of 231.02 is key to this primary bullish count, with upside targets on the 5-minute micro scale for 1, 3, iii and (1) being 220, 250, 275 and 335, respectively.\n\nBut I must ~~caution~~: Wave i was a Leading Diagonal, which can look corrective. Of course ii has been corrective, as it should be, with all overlapping waves. A break of 172.50 opens the discussion to the downside in deeper Green 4 (or the Alt Yellow count with its greasy black peel). As long as we hold above that support, we will have plenty to talk about to the upside.\n\n**My Position:** I added another 4 shares at $200. I'm layering in as I can now, because a break to the upside over $231 and the minor wave 2 pullback after that (maybe $220) may be the last good buying opportunity (not as good as now, but for those waiting... yadda yadda yadda). Ape Strong. I like the stock, I'm hodling. \n\n**My Opinion:** If you think this post is FUD, you spelled it wrong. Drop the D. If you are confused, see r/ElliottWaveTrading to learn the basics of how to read this.\n\n**Also:** I will post the Bigger Picture (60-minute candles) this weekend after the markets close Friday. The upside targets are pretty awesome. (Sneak peek of (iii) is on the chart for this post. yw.)\n\nDisclaimer: \"Is she a pro? At this point Dan, we DON'T know\" - This is not trading advice.

An s&p 500 inclusion means institutions will buy in and shorts will be completely fked.\n\nRequirements for s&p 500 inclusion: \n\n1. US company\n2. Market cap > 9.8B\n3. trailing 4 quarters profitable\n4. enough public float (at least 10% of shares outstanding)\n\nThere was a rule change a few years back about multitiered shares structure which I'll talk about later.\n\nFirst lets check the requirements:\n\n1. check, they are based in michigan and do US mortgage business\n2. total market cap is $40B, the current publicly traded shares total \\~$3B. I will talk about this later together with the multi-tiered share structure.\n3. they've only been public for 3 quarters, but there's no doubt they will be profitable the next quarter and beyond.\n\nFor point 4, we need to take a detailed look at RKT's ownership structure, which is pretty complicated. You can read about the details in their [S1](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1805284/000104746920004008/a2241988zs-1.htm), but I can quickly summarize here (skipping over some details): Basically Rocket Companies owns about 8% of the whole business through class A shares, each with 1 vote and 100% economic interest (dividends); Dan Gilbert and Rock Holdings Inc owns the rest through class D shares, each with 10 votes and 0% economic interest. Class B and C shares were only used for IPO purposes and are irrelevant now. Class D shares can be converted to class A shares through holding units which will also convert the voting power and economic interest. \n\nThere was a rule change after snapchat's IPO (where they issued shares with no voting power), that says you need a single tiered structure for your common shares (so that voting power is equalized with ownership) to be join the s&p. Preferred shares don't count towards this since they have no voting power. Right now RKT has these 2 classes of shares, so that's an obstacle to s&p inclusion. However, there are 2 key points that suggest Dan Gilbert will change this soon:\n\n1. These classes are convertible. They created this holding unit thing already at IPO that can equalize the voting power and economic rights.\n2. RKT approved a buy back of $1B over 2 years from Nov 2020. Their current public float is 115M x \\~$23 = \\~$2.65B. Now why would they buy back \\~40% of the shares that they just sold in the public market within 2 years of IPO? No that doesn't make sense. They are looking to convert D shares and sell them. But they won't sell them in the open market and drive the prices plummeting; they are likely looking to take on more institutional partners. Dan Gilbert is really good friends with Buffet, and there was a rumor of Hathaway buying a stake in RKT. You get the idea. \n\nOnce these things happen, RKT will be primed to be included in the S&P 500. When will this happen you ask? No one knows, but I think likely within the 2 year buy back period. So If you are long shares I wouldn't worry about the noise happening right now. I sold for some profit near the peak 2 weeks ago, still holding shares and leaps. I also think there will likely be a second spike/bleed up, and may sell for some more profit, but I will for sure hold some shares long term or buy back in at some point.","created_utc":"2021-03-18 19:00:03","num_comments":84,"score":361,"upvote_ratio":0.8,"is_original_content":false,"permalink":"/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m835pq/rkts_road_to_sp500/","title":"RKT's road to S&P500","author":"CMScientist","firstseen":"2021-03-24 21:45:34.443328"}

China stocks, despite the usual china shenanigans, are comparatively cheap. Chinese only have like 11% of their wealth in stocks, which will increase substantially, driving up multiples. If it drops with the market, it won't drop as much and should recover faster.\n\nMy plays: sell puts and covered calls on FXI. I'll plow the returns back into FXI to increase the money I can make. FXI has some tech too but comparatively undervalued tech (BABA) plus a 2.1% dividend. This will be my play this year.\n\nI know China gets a lot of hate, but it's too undervalued given its economic position. The macroeconomics are just too much in China's favor, despite the known risks (accounting shenanigans, etc). I will start with a 200k allocation and should generate 3 - 5k a month through this strategy (18-30% return).

Dashed line is a Fibonacci Retracement drawing, and the solid is a Fibonacci Extension drawing. If you don't know anything about Fibonacci, Google him. But that's irrelevant. All you apes need to know is this:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnything bouncing off that 50% *dashed* line, is a GOOD sign. It means that there's a strong chance the retracement has stopped there and will move upward further. However, that upward movement MUST be accompanied by volume. Without buy pressure, it will just continue to trade sideways between $193 and $230. To get AND STAY above $230 is key because for every resistance we break, the upward momentum will continue to carry the price of the stock higher, but again that requires UNYIELDING bullish pressure.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere's where it gets shitty. Overall, this stock is way way too volatile for it to follow trends and drawings like most others. Seeing it bounce of 50% over and over means it usually will break DOWN to 61.8% and if you don't know anything about Fibonacci, know this:\n\n***IF IT DROPS BELOW 61.8% IT WILL MORE THAN LIKELY GO BACK DOWN TO A FULL RETRACEMENT (AKA $40).***\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, all this data is based on the last month, so this projection will only be good to look at for another month *roughly.* As I'm sure you've seen over and over, holding may not be enough anymore. We need bullish pushes to get over the next two resistances, and once we break those it's moon time. When/if we break $348 *consistently,* the next resistance isn't until $416, but with that kind of upward momentum, it'll easily get to $482.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWHEN IT HITS $482, IT WILL GO UNTIL IT CREATES A NEW ATH, WHICH IS DETERMINED SOLELY BY BUY PRESSURE VS. SELL PRESSURE. And you can bet your ass the hedgies will do the same shit and try their asses off to tank it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'll say this to end it: The new ATH could  ***VERY REALISTICALLY*** be over $673 a share. It's also equally as likely that this retraces back to $40 a share because of too much sideways trading and no pressure to push past resistances. We need buying pressure, not holding, but holding is still good because it isn't promoting selling, and the more we buy AND hold, the less there is to short (excluding naked shorts which we know hedgies love).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*P.S. I like the stock.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: My hope for this post isn't to see anyone get üßªüôå or even to continue üíéüôå. It's to shed light on the distinct possibilities for GME.

Real yields of cash are even worse though not as negative as they were in the 1930-45 and 1915-20 great monetization periods. Nominal bond yields are just off the lowest ever made a couple of weeks ago. These extremely low or nonexistent yields do not meet these asset holders‚Äô funding needs. For example, pension funds, insurance companies, sovereign wealth funds, and savings accounts cannot meet their financial needs with these investments so holding bonds assures their failure to meet their obligations. At the same time, while there is some room for diversification benefit, because of limitations of how low interest rates can go, bond prices are close to their upper limits in price, which makes being short them a relatively low-risk bet. The charts below that go back to 1900 show these things‚Äîreal bond yields, nominal bond yields, and nominal/real cash rates for the US, Europe, and Japan.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/323eqxpidun61.png?width=1680&format=png&auto=webp&s=aab459a2f584cfe7156f71fa8e6a1a487f9a13e3\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rqoo4wkmdun61.png?width=1680&format=png&auto=webp&s=a3488ab237e8e398400181fde1fa7d5b42f0b810\n\nThe economics of investing in bonds (and most financial assets) has become stupid. Think about it. The purpose of investing is to have money in a storehold of wealth that you can convert into buying power at a later date. When one invests one gives a lump-sum payment for payments in the future. Let‚Äôs look at what that deal now looks like. If I give $100 today how many years do I have to wait to get my $100 back and then start collecting the reward on top of what I gave? In US, European, Japanese, and Chinese bonds an investor has to wait roughly 42 years, 450 years, 150 years, and 25 years\\[1\\] respectively to get one‚Äôs money back and then one gets low or nil nominal returns. However, because you are trying to store buying power you have to take into consideration inflation. In the US you have to wait over 500 years, and you will never get your buying power back in Europe or Japan. In fact, if you buy bonds in these countries now you will be guaranteed to have a lot less buying power in the future. Rather than get paid less than inflation why not instead buy stuff‚Äîany stuff‚Äîthat will equal inflation or better? We see a lot of investments that we expect to do significantly better than inflation. The charts below show these payback periods for holding cash and bonds in the US, in both nominal and real terms. As shown, it is the longest ever and obviously a ridiculous amount of time.\n\n\\[1\\] Based on current levels of 30-year nominal bond yields (treated as a perpetuity).\n\n[\\[2\\] Bond payback periods are based on 30-year bond yields. ](https://preview.redd.it/lhvzs6osdun61.png?width=1680&format=png&auto=webp&s=7c2cd38430383dcb8343845f34377233c0c1a9f3)\n\n**The world is a) substantially overweighted in bonds** (and other financial assets, especially US bonds) at the same time that b) governments (especially the US) are producing enormous amounts more debt and bonds and other debt assets. This is particularly true for US bonds. US bond holdings are over a third of global bond holdings held by central banks, sovereign wealth funds, and international investors with the next largest country/currency bond being euro bonds at only roughly 60% of US bond holdings. \\[3\\] Their overweighted position in US bonds is largely because of the ‚Äúexorbitant privilege‚Äù the US has had being the world‚Äôs leading reserve currency, which has allowed the US to overborrow for decades. The cycle of becoming a reserve currency, overborrowing, and being overindebted threatening the reserve currency status is classic. As part of this cycle there is the emergence of the currency and capital markets of the rising and competing empire. Consistent with this classic cycle there is now a shifting from US bonds to Chinese bonds going on. Chinese bond holdings held by international investors are rising fast, though they are now only about 6% of allocations in global portfolios. This shift is going on because a) global investors are overweighted in US bonds and underweighted in Chinese bonds relative to sensible criteria of what weights should be based on sensible portfolio-weighting processes, such as the relative sizes of their economies, their relative shares of world trade, and the relative sizes of their capital markets, b) Chinese bond and other capital markets investments are growing fast and are increasingly open to foreign investment, c) Chinese bonds offer relatively attractive yields with relatively attractive currency returns because of China‚Äôs favorable balance of payments conditions, and d) China‚Äôs currency is increasingly being internationalized. That whole set of supply-and-demand circumstances makes for a dangerous picture for bonds, cash, and currencies in the three major reserve currencies of the dollar, the euro, and the yen. If the new demand for these bonds falls significantly short of the new supply, which seems likely, either a) interest rates will rise and bond prices will fall or b) central banks will have to print substantial amounts of money to buy the debt assets that the free-market buyer won‚Äôt buy, which would be very reflationary (bearish for the dollar and the leading currencies who do this, relative to reflation assets).\n\n\\[3\\] Estimate based on weights in global bond indices.\n\n*If bond prices fall significantly that will produce significant losses for holders of them, which could encourage more selling*. Bonds have been in a 40-year bull market that has rewarded those who were long and penalized those who were short, so the bull market has produced a large number of comfortable longs who haven‚Äôt gotten seriously stung by a price decline. That is one of the markers of a bubble.\n\n***Imagine what would happen if, for any or all of these reasons, the holders of these debt assets wanted to sell them***\\*\\*.\\*\\* There is now over $75 trillion of US debt assets of varying maturities. US Treasury bonds and notes account for $16 trillion \\[4\\] of this and US Treasury securities of other maturities account for another $5 trillion. \\[5\\] Holders of these debt assets will either hold them until maturity and endure the previously described terrible returns or sell them. Most holders of debt assets believe that they can sell them to get cash and to buy goods and services with. After all, the only purpose of holding financial assets is to be able to convert them into the buying of goods and services. The problem is that, at current valuations, there is way too much money in these financial assets for it to be a realistic expectation that any significant percentage of that bond money can be turned into cash and exchanged for goods and services. If any significant amount tried to make that shift a ‚Äúrun on the bank\"-type dynamic would ensue. When such a dynamic - which I call a \"reverse wave‚Äù - occurs there is no stopping it. It has to be accommodated the way it was accommodated in the 1930-45 period and the 1970-80 period (and hundreds of similar periods throughout history) via printing a lot of money and devaluing it, and restructuring a lot of debt and government finances, usually including large increases in taxes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ksj86y5vgun61.png?width=1680&format=png&auto=webp&s=7b13c7b38214f895d291ef86aa8df78da0fedd50\n\n\\[4\\] Includes notes, bonds, TIPS, and floating rate notes  ex-intragovernmental holdings. See treasurydirect.gov if interested in  more detail on the current indebtedness of the US government.\\[5\\] Note that there is additionally around $7 trillion of other US government debt held by internal government funds.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**History and logic show that central banks, when faced with the supply/demand imbalance situation that would lead interest rates to rise to more than is desirable in light of economic circumstances, will print the money to buy bonds and create ‚Äúyield curve controls‚Äù to put a cap on bond yields and will devalue cash.** That makes cash terrible to own and great to borrow. Through their powers central banks can, at least temporarily, put a lid on interest rates and keep short-term interest rates low relative to long-term rates so that it becomes profitable to buy bonds with cash, which central banks abundantly provide which makes real interest rates very negative. For example, during the 1930-45 period the Fed kept the bond yield around 2.5% and the cash yield around 1%, which made it profitable to borrow cash and use it to buy and own bonds. While that can make holding bonds financed with cash profitable at low rates, under such circumstances both the cash rate and the bond rate are bad. Naturally, because cash rates are so low it pays to borrow cash and invest it in investments that are higher-returning. Back in the 1930-45 period, the Fed was able to keep yields there, and the way they did that was also through outlawing gold and the movement of capital elsewhere. So, when I look at it, while I want to be short bonds (because they have the most terrible fundamentals), I do know that central bankers can keep cash more terrible, and I do know that they might have to prevent the movement to other storehold of wealth assets and other countries.\n\nSuch moves would signal the beginning of the very last and most disruptive stage of the long-term debt cycle. So, watch central bankers‚Äô actions - i.e., see if they increase their bond buying when interest rates are rising led by long-term interest rates and when the markets and economy are strong - because that action would signal that they are experiencing supply/demand problems. Also, watch the rates of change in the injections of these stimulants in relation to the effects they are having on the economy‚Äôs vigour because the more stimulants that are being applied per unit of growth, the less effective they are and the more serious the situation is.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know this all sounds crazy to you. It sounds pretty crazy to me, too. However, I have seen this confluence of circumstances leading to this sort of dynamic many times in my study of markets and economies over the last several hundred years and I experienced this dynamic myself (in 1970-80).\n\n## This Dynamic Is Typical of the Late Stage of the Long-Term Debt Cycle\n\nRather than being unusual, the dynamic I am describing has happened repeatedly throughout history. While I will briefly explain how the cycle works here, if you want a more comprehensive explanation, I will direct you to my ‚ÄúThe Changing World Order‚Äù study, which you can find [here](https://www.principles.com/the-changing-world-order/).\n\nSuch moves would signal the beginning of the very last and most disruptive stage of the long-term debt cycle. So, watch central bankers‚Äô actions‚Äîi.e., see if they increase their bond buying when interest rates are rising led by long-term interest rates and when the markets and economy are strong‚Äîbecause that action would signal that they are experiencing supply/demand problems. Also, watch the rates of change in the injections of these stimulants in relation to the effects they are having on the economy‚Äôs vigor because the more stimulants that are being applied per unit of growth, the less effective they are and the more serious the situation is.\n\nI know this all sounds crazy to you. It sounds pretty crazy to me, too. However, I have seen this confluence of circumstances leading to this sort of dynamic many times in my study of markets and economies over the last several hundred years and I experienced this dynamic myself (in 1970-80).\n\nAs explained over the previous few years that cycle is only one of the three really big cycles‚Ä¶\n\n1. the credit/debt cycle,\n2. the internal conflict cycle due to wealth, values, and political gaps, and\n3. the external conflict cycle due to the leading world power, its world order, and its reserve currency (now the US) being challenged by the leading rising power (China).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe ‚ÄúBig Cycle‚Äù dynamic of these big forces interacting is described much more comprehensively in my study ‚Äú[The Changing World Order](https://www.principles.com/the-changing-world-order/).‚Äù I think it‚Äôs very important so, if you haven‚Äôt read it, I urge you to.\n\n## Enter a Pandemic, and Here We Are\n\nWhile the previously mentioned three big issues had been brewing for a number of years, about a year ago the world was hit with a pandemic (COVID-19), the economy‚Äôs pulse plunged, and the ‚Äúdoctors‚Äù ran to the patient and gave it a huge injection of stimulation. To get money into the hands of the people they wanted to get it to when interest rates were at 0%, the policy maker ‚Äúdoctors‚Äù had to do what I call Monetary Policy 3 (MP3). MP3 is the coordination of fiscal policy (in which the central government borrows and directs the money to those they want to get it) and monetary policy (in which the central bank prints money and buys the government‚Äôs debt). It classically comes when the more traditional policies such as lowering interest rates (MP1) and printing of money and buying financial assets (MP2) won‚Äôt get money to the people who need it most because the normal capital markets money and credit allocation process directs money to those who are positioned to make money and/or who have a lot of money rather than to those who need it most. That is the main structural issue that I believe has to be dealt with in the ways I explained in my piece ‚ÄúWhy and How Capitalism Needs to Be Reformed‚Äù and why MP3 is used.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe most recently passed fiscal stimulus bill created a lot of funding and a lot of debt that is many times that which is needed to cover the financing hole (the ‚Äúdoctors‚Äù ran to the patient and gave it a huge injection of stimulation). Besides providing funds to deal with the economic consequences of COVID-19 it was a giant Universal Basic Income (UBI)‚Äîi.e., a giant redistribution funded by borrowing and monetizing. I‚Äôm not saying that policy makers should have done anything differently as I certainly see the need for such assistance and because it‚Äôs not my job to say who should get how much money and how policy makers should weigh the benefits of doing this against the costs of doing it‚Äîi.e., the implications of a huge amount of debt and money creation. I‚Äôm just a practical global macro investor focusing on the mechanics and its implications trying to stay one step ahead of the crowd, and I‚Äôm just explaining that these circumstances created a lot of government debt‚Äîi.e., because there wasn‚Äôt enough free-market buying of this debt, central banks had to buy it and had to print a lot of money to buy it with‚Äîso much so that they drove rates down to ‚Äúartificially‚Äù low levels, which ‚Äúartificially‚Äù supported financial asset prices. That move was a classic move. Now, there‚Äôs just so much money injected into the markets and the economy that the markets are like a casino with people playing with funny money. They‚Äôre buying all sorts of things and pushing yields on everything down. Now you have stocks that have gone up, and you have classic bubble dynamics in so many different assets. The following charts show the longer-term picture of the US government‚Äôs budget deficits (deficits are near WWII levels), the United States‚Äô current account deficit, and Federal Reserve debt monetization. It also shows how the US fiscal support compares to the rest of the world (much larger). While 2020 and 2021 were exceptional years that led to exceptionally large deficits (like the war years) these deficits are likely to remain large until they can‚Äôt remain large anymore.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qmvxr4cniun61.png?width=1680&format=png&auto=webp&s=a01479544fb1849d4928ac5a4b6f57ac575de495\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2ltdv9soiun61.png?width=1680&format=png&auto=webp&s=3421c280b1cb2448bce42c506e04c1f0ced53db1\n\nIn my examination of history over many centuries and in many places, I have seen many analogous cases, and by studying them have seen how  these things work, many of which are covered in my \"[The Changing World Order](https://www.principles.com/the-changing-world-order/)\" study.\n\n## Looking Ahead and What to Do\n\nBecause I believe that we are in the late stage of this Big Debt Cycle that mechanistically works in the way I described, I believe cash is and will continue to be trash (i.e., have returns that are significantly negative relative to inflation) so it pays to a) borrow cash rather than to hold it as an asset and b) buy higher-returning, non-debt investment assets.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBased both on how things have worked historically and what is happening now, I am confident that tax changes will also play an important role in driving capital flows to different investment assets and different locations, and those movements will influence market movements. If history and logic are to be a guide, policy makers who are short of money will raise taxes and won‚Äôt like these capital movements out of debt assets and into other storehold of wealth assets and other tax domains so they could very well impose prohibitions against capital movements to other assets (e.g., gold, bit coin, etc.) and other locations. These tax changes could be more shocking than expected. For example, Elizabeth Warren‚Äôs proposed wealth tax is of an unprecedented size that, based on my study of wealth taxes in other countries at other times, will most likely lead to more capital outflows and other moves to evade these taxes. The United States could become perceived as a place that is inhospitable to capitalism and capitalists. Though this specific wealth tax bill is unlikely to pass this year the chances of a sizable wealth tax bill passing over the next few years are significant. Conflicts can increase in such difficult times when accompanied by large wealth, values, and political gaps, and the environment can become inhospitable to capitalists leading them to run from less hospitable places to more hospitable places.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think this is the new paradigm.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**For these reasons I believe a well-diversified portfolio of non-debt and non-dollar assets along with a short cash position is preferable to a traditional stock/bond mix that is heavily skewed to US dollars. I also believe that assets in the mature developed reserve currency countries will underperform the Asian (including Chinese) emerging countries‚Äô markets. I also believe that one should be mindful of tax changes and the possibility of capital controls.**\n\n[**https://www.bridgewater.com/research-and-insights/why-in-the-world-would-you-own-bonds-when**](https://www.bridgewater.com/research-and-insights/why-in-the-world-would-you-own-bonds-when)","created_utc":"2021-03-18 16:26:42","num_comments":28,"score":57,"upvote_ratio":0.9,"is_original_content":false,"permalink":"/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m7zuqq/why_in_the_world_would_you_own_bonds_when/","title":"Why in the World Would You Own Bonds When‚Ä¶","author":"Lowfry","firstseen":"2021-03-24 21:45:34.454109"}

Just like the idea, that some of the hedgies want other hedgies to be smashed. They don't really have a huge position and won't have any big impact on the price of GME. All other options you can see are outdated and the accuracy of these options cannot be granted. Don't try to speculate, since you cannot tell whether they're still in or not.\n\nFor all of you who don't know what call options are, the spanish asset manager bets that the price of GME will be above 200$ tomorrow, which would definitely be amazing for us apes. I am explaining in the following pictures why exactly.\n\n\n\nPICTURE 3:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/opnh5k177tn61.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bede88f52d218976b6f0cff114ba4ce8fa52d1b1\n\nOkay so, this is where the important stuff is displayed. We can see that 11,681 options are expiring tomorrow if the price hits 250$, which is currently not the case. (GME at 211$ while I'm writing this DD). This would mean at this point over 2509 call options COULD, not have to, execute tomorrow ~ 250k shares COULD be bought. Keep in mind, that most people don't execute their calls, but rather just sell them.\n\nImportant info: I am only taking into account call options from 160$ - 250$ as you can see, since I didnt want to add all the amounts from 100$ to idk where. So you can expect that there are at least over 1000 options expiring aswell at the strike price of 100$. But I know some would argue about this, and this is why I am just calculating with the options shown in the screenshot.\n\n\n\nSO: If GME hits 250$ by tomorrow over 1,2 mio shares COULD be bought, assuming that all people execute the calls, but this doesn't really has a huge importance since marketmakers begin to buy shares already in case of someone executes his options. 1,2 mio shares being bought at the same point, or even half of it -> huge price jump. But also 100k or 200k shares would create a price jump and therefore COULD lead to the so-called gamma squeeze (hitting higher stock prices, causing other options to be in the money, and so on). I don't say that it for sure will cause a gamma squeeze. It just could end up in the situation we're all striving for.\n\n\n\nPICTURE 4:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t7m7flh59tn61.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f98da6a0969261cbe0dc220bc4a1ef24ffb4b21b\n\nOkay so, now we come to the point where you can clearly see why it's kind of important for GME to be over 200$ by tomorrow. If GME is UNDER 200$ TOMORROW, over 12k put options (1,2 mio shares) CAN be executed, which would cause a price drop. That doesn't automatically mean that the gamma squeeze possibility is non-existent anymore, but it would definitely mean that we would have to wait for the next expiration date to let it happen. It also doesn't mean that everyone really executes his options, since like I said, most of them never get executed.\n\n\n\nNow we come to the huge BUT part:\n\nIF GME IS ABOVE 200$ TOMORROW, WE HAVE NEARLY NO PUT OPTIONS THAT ARE OF ANY IMPORTANCE ANYMORE. This means, that there would really be no huge downward pressure on the price, outgoing from options, if it starts to rise. You can check this by yourself on other platforms. There are not a lot put calls on GME over the strike price of 200$.\n\n\n\n\n\nPicture 5:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ofxur2biatn61.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=681866a6b46249f775ac5ddefd2c900cb4135d64\n\nThis is again very interesting imo, since we can clearly see, that the ETF objectives increased their positions by over 10%. OVER 10% !!! Since Blackrock owns almost 10mio shares which are mostly in ETFs (I KNOW THIS FROM MY OWN BLOOMBERG RESEARCH BUT YOU CAN OFC JUST DONT TRUST ME. THEN IGNORE THE FOLLOWING SENTENCE) , I ASSUME that BLACKROCK (LARGEST ASSET MANAGER IN THE WORLD) is on our side and wants GME to skyrocket. Very good information, so do I think. We also see an overall increase in positions, except from one fund objective, the value fund objective (betting on stocks that are in their opinion undervalued). I know there were a lot of posts about Blackrock being on Citadels site. Which is just as likely. I don't have more information than you have. But Blackrock is the biggest shareholder of GME and has most of its stocks in ETFS.\n\nThe ETF increase could also just mean that another Hedgefund, not called Blackrock, increased their position in ETFs. Everything is possible.\n\n\n\nLast picture:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7mlji2q9btn61.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=947b90a1993cf426da98ee679e8732a10dfd82e7\n\nThis really contains no helpful information, but I just want to show you that all short sellers stopped reporting short interest since the 02/26/2021 (When GME started to rise from 40$ on february 22nd to 265$ on march 10th.). Although short interest usually got reported on the 15th each month, we still have no recent reports. Seems a bit sketchy, imo. But this could also just mean nothing.\n\n\n\nI don't want to get anybody buy GME due to my posts, since I am mostly making assumptions here and personally just find it really suspicious. I know we all find the situation really suspicious.\n\n\n\nI THANK EVERYBODY FOR READING THIS AND WHICH ALL OF US GOOD LUCK IN THE WAR! I AM HYPED FOR POWER HOUR AND IF GME IS ABLE TO STAY ABOVE 200$. but keep in mind, we have many evidences, that other HFs are on our side, besides from my assumptions that Blackrock wants GME to skyrocket. Please read other DD's if you want to have more info about this topic particularly. I can recommend DD's by u/HeyItsPixel about this topic.\n\n\n\nHAVE A NICE EVENING EVERYBODY. I LOVE YOU ALL.\n\n\n\nPS: Holy shit this really took me an hour to make.\n\n\n\nEDIT: GME DOES NOT HAVE TO CLOSE ABOVE 200$ TOMORROW! THIS ALSO DOESNT MEAN THAT \"GME IS OVER\" OR SOME SH** IF IT CLOSES UNDER 200. I WILL HOLD MY SHARES UNTIL GME HITS 1 MIL. I DONT CARE IF IT IS TOMORROW, NEXT WEEK, NEXT MONTH OR NEXT YEAR. PLEASE DONT GET THE IMPRESSION THAT I SAID THAT GME HAS TO CLOSE ABOVE A SPECIFIC RANGE**. I WANTED TO SAY THE GAMMA SQUEEZE IS MOST LIKELY TO EXPECT TOMORROW OR MONDAY WHEN GME IS ABOVE 200$ TOMORROW SINCE MOST OPTIONS EXPIRE ON MARCH 19th which is information we already had a long time ago. I held my shares while being at -90% and I will hold them until they're at +69,420%. My personal opinion.**\n\nEDIT 2 : My main goal is not to motivate you, promise you anything or predict anything. My intention of my every two-day Bloomberg updates are to show you how the market does and if retail is selling or anything. That‚Äôs all. If you‚Äôre not interested in my text, don‚Äôt read it and just look at the screenshots and make your own opinions. I know, that not all options have to be executed and most of them probably are not being executed.\n\nEDIT 3: I also did not say that Blackrock IS FOR SURE ON OUR SIDE, but Blackrock is the one having most shares embedded in ETFs. And as you can see, the positions in ETFs increased by 10%. This also COULD MEAN THAT ANOTHER HEDGEFUND OR ASSET MANAGER JUST INCREASED THEIR POSITION!! Don't get me wrong, PLEASE!\n\nFor real, it just makes me sad that so many people misunderstand me and think \"I am one of them\", \"trying to say that GME HAS TO CLOSE ABOVE 200$ tomorrow or it crashes\" or say that I said \"all options are for sure being exectued\". I never said such things and that was never my intention. I am not going to make any more updates.\n\nTL;DR:\n\nIF GME ABOVE 200$ PREPARE FOR LIFTOFF. IF UNDER: GET YOUR MONEY TOGETHER CUZ ITS A FIRE SALE\n\nAll the credit goes to u/Bullmarket_chaser who couldn't post the original DD on r/wallstreebets.\n\nCheck the original DD here: https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m7usgx/final_bloomberg_update_on_031821_the_endgame_is/","created_utc":"2021-03-18 15:38:13","num_comments":291,"score":2588,"upvote_ratio":0.96,"is_original_content":false,"permalink":"/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m7yw5z/gme_bloomberg_terminal_update_031821_the_endgame/","title":"GME Bloomberg Terminal Update 03/18/21 | THE ENDGAME IS NEAR","author":"Ayudante_semianonimo","firstseen":"2021-03-24 21:45:34.456818"}

It is also useful to compare a security to its industry, as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area.\n\nFor HL, shares are up 1.55% over the past week while the Zacks Mining - Silver industry is up 3.14% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 7.69% compares favorably with the industry's 2.46% performance as well.\n\nConsidering longer term price metrics, like performance over the last three months or year, can be advantageous as well. Over the past quarter, shares of Hecla Mining have risen 81.87%, and are up 238.2% in the last year. On the other hand, the S&P 500 has only moved 15.35% and 21.49%, respectively.\n\nInvestors should also pay attention to HL's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. HL is currently averaging 12,480,946 shares for the last 20 days.\n\nEarnings Outlook\n\nThe Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions, in addition to price changes. Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well. A nice path here can help show promise, and we have recently been seeing that with HL.\n\nOver the past two months, 3 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost HL's consensus estimate, increasing from -$0.01 to $0.14 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 2 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.\n\nBottom Line\n\nTaking into account all of these elements, it should come as no surprise that HL is a #2 (Buy) stock with a Momentum Score of B. If you've been searching for a fresh pick that's set to rise in the near-term, make sure to keep Hecla Mining on your short list.\n\nDisclosures: this is an article published by Zacks Research on NASDAQ ([https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/heres-why-hecla-mining-hl-is-a-great-momentum-stock-to-buy-2020-09-01](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/heres-why-hecla-mining-hl-is-a-great-momentum-stock-to-buy-2020-09-01))\n\nThis is not financial or legal advice.

This is by far the most bullish upgrade, we‚Äôve seen, though WedBush doubling to $30 from $16 is significant in its own right (100% increase in fair value from their view). Unfortunately, there is a major conflict of interest with Jefferies.\n\nBank analyst are called ‚ÄúSell-Side‚Äù because they sell research reports and don‚Äôt manage stock portfolios. They sell these research reports to the ‚Äúbuy-side‚Äù, but the majority of their income is derived by helping bankers win deals and traders get volume to their desk.\n\nTechnically speaking, it‚Äôs illegal for research and banking to intertwine, but it‚Äôs not an uncommon practice for bankers to imply to smaller clients that their research analyst ‚Äòmight‚Äô initiate or maintain coverage if they raise capital through them. I‚Äôve seen research analysts discontinue coverage on names only to cite ‚Äúa lack of potential to monetize via banking as the reason‚Äù.\n\nThe other way is by generating trade revenues which is self-explanatory. Sales sends around the research note and pitch an idea, then the execution traders place the order, sometimes after further coaxing from research.\n\nThe reason Jefferies is sketchy is because they are the firm through which GME has the standing ATM agreement. Basically, Jefferies can raise capital for GME by selling new shares into the open market. This is effectively a hybrid of a banking (equity capital markets) and sales and trading desk. In other words, this is something that directly monetizes research.\n\nIt‚Äôs not a huge leap to see how GME longs could get screwed in this scenario. GME discloses an ATM agreement yesterday, then suddenly the bank that can raise capital for GME at market price releases a super bullish report with a price target well above the current market price. It‚Äôs not a leap to see how they benefit in this outcome given they‚Äôll be comped on a percentage of the deal.\n\nBe careful out there!\n\nEdit- I didn‚Äôt see this when I posted, but this also comes after GME stated they‚Äôre considering upping the ATM equity line. So the bullish report comes after signs the deal could be even more profitable than before (likely in the event the price remained elevated).","created_utc":"2021-03-24 18:43:13","num_comments":10,"score":21,"upvote_ratio":0.86,"is_original_content":false,"permalink":"/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mciwoa/jefferies_upped_gme_to_175_from_15_but_they_have/","title":"Jefferies Upped GME to $175 from $15, But They Have A Huge Conflict Of Interest","author":"BagofBabbish","firstseen":"2021-03-24 23:04:34.800088"}

{"_id":{"$oid":"605bc58269d953883ab1c1da"},"id":"mcik9i","fullname":"t3_mcik9i","selftext":"RKT's position cost distribution (shown below) shows that 94% of the shareholders are in the red. This almost always happens with manipulation in small cap and pennystocks, not with a $40B company like RKT. Even when [GME dipped to around $50 it wasn't that bad](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lcsh17/gme_positions_cost_distributionaverage_price_paid/); that was a drop of >90% from the high of $483 on a universally agreed manipulated stock.\n\nNow before you go on to babble about how RKT shareholders are a bunch of bagholding losers, remember what happened to GME after its brief stay at $50. The extreme shareholder cost position distribution happens when the stock price is not representative of the stock's value - a market inefficiency created by low volume and short positions. Let me illustrate with an extreme example: Let's say there is some distribution of shareholders with varying entry prices, with an average of say $100. Now trading grinds to a halt and only one share is traded, and someone fatfingers a trade at $20. Now the stock price shows up as $20, but do you really think the value of the stock is $20? No, this is a situation created by illiquidity. RKT's volume is at \\~10m now, about 1/40 of the 400m peak day on Mar 3rd. GME was also at around 10m near the end of Feb, compared to a high of under 200m shares. In other words, RKT's liquidity issue is twice as bad as GME.\n\nThis is made even worse by short positions. For normal trading between holders of real shares, for every buyer there is a seller. So as people trade there is a natural tendency to balance out (where there are more shareholder in a certain price range, the more likely there will be sellers there; where there is no shareholders, it can only increase). But when a short seller sells shares, they only contribute to increase buyers and don't take away shareholders from any price range. So then they leave behind an unnatural cost distribution.\n\nOn the other hand, a stock depressed by illiquidity and short selling will explode in price, as long as there is one high volume day to trigger the movement. The spring is set and loaded on RKT, and the action will take place shortly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9rfyqgm9u1p61.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=34d9faa3589b362a94f2270cc9120fa1862947b5","created_utc":"2021-03-24 18:27:52","num_comments":11,"score":31,"upvote_ratio":0.8,"is_original_content":false,"permalink":"/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mcik9i/position_cost_distribution_shows_rkts_stock_is/","title":"Position cost distribution shows RKT's stock is ready to explode","author":"CMScientist","firstseen":"2021-03-24 23:04:34.813702"}

Best case, this will benefit the hedge funds, market makers and DTCC by giving them breathing room to come up with damage-limiting strategies to cover their corruption. Worst case, they might decide forced liquidations of the counterfeit shares at a \"reasonable price is the best course of action, to prevent contagion and ensure stability\" yadda yadda yadda. I can hear the soundbites already.\n\nThe SEC has known full-well for years what's been going on and never moved.

But not before.\n\nMy 2 cents of non-financial advice.\n\nEdit: Some people really want to take action.

And my assumptions of what will happen in a few days.... and really in a few short weeks/months....\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Section 1:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8ziqjx36l2p61.png?width=400&format=png&auto=webp&s=5d7cf52fef13d710bf656544fdab1dc91940bf35\n\n**Prelude:** the market in the last few weeks (since January):\n\nOk, so we just went through a F\\*ton of events these past few weeks. Major volatile catalysts and reasons to push things around up and down such as:\n\n\\-new election (trump stepping down and not causing a bigger fuss to the markets as he did in jan/feb)\n\n\\-these years housing numbers, unemployment numbers, inflation targets(predictions)\n\n\\-Biden getting started and giving hope to the economy and people.\n\n\\-biden giving out new stimmies\n\n\\-housing market still roaring.\n\n\\-other economies around the world roaring and US roaring (despite volatility)\n\n\\-Tax season pushed, inflation supposedly not here (yes but no depends on who u ask and who cares)\n\n\\-most companies reporting ER the first q 1 2021 of companies doing not so hot (mostly)\n\n\\-Quad witching again, March quad witching was def a doozy as it always is... and 1 year anniversary of the \"march lows\"\n\n\\- LASTLY and prob most importantly. THE REAL ROLL OUT of the vaccines is here. NOW. finally.\n\n\\^\\^\\^\\^ These are huge catalyst political events and financial events that can never be accounted for no matter what algo you have. these types of events occur once maybe twice in a lifetime.\n\n**Section 2**\n\n**Today and what the F\\* is happening ......**\n\nAlright section 1 is a lot of stuff that has happened that has created 1/3 haircut to most tech stocks 1/2 price butcher the rest \"frothy\" stocks (as CNBC likes to put it). However, not all spec high risk or \"risk-on\" has gotten haircuts..... OG boomer stocks and trad and large-cap has also gotten close to a 1/3 haircut BUT...\n\n**Section 3**\n\n**Roaring next few days my prediction (certainly next few weeks)**\n\n**What I think is going to happen and what I think is happening.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Old sport showing us the roaring 20's](https://preview.redd.it/l8qs1jggl2p61.png?width=320&format=png&auto=webp&s=0d817d59bb66913551e12c6ce49398ad6d7f9a24)\n\nOVer the last 2 weeks if you notice we are making higher lows on SPY and forming a baseline.\n\nNew tech /risk-on/spec stocks have come up from that nasty low we got 2 ish weeks ago where all of us thought we were going down to \" back to recession March-ish lows 2020). They are not where it were before the nasty sell-offs we had...., however other OG and boomer (and other stocks) stocks are back and even higher than before.... T\n\nthat is the SPY /NASDAQ and other ETFs are up. SPY is at 390 ish levels without risk on stocks help!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***When has this happened before? like a rotation out of the sector, BUT major indices up at all-time highs???***\n\n[I found a spy minion with 400 on it. A sing that SPY 400 this week](https://preview.redd.it/dv5rswyal2p61.png?width=360&format=png&auto=webp&s=b432ab82d4913c407926134b7214f2b5c5d8bec8)\n\n***No matter what I hear I see this being an unprecedented time....and something that smart money/MM/hedge funds/ etc... know about. and have already planned out how they're going to play it....***\n\nThat is for once SPY (even though it weighs heavily on tech stocks for it to go up) is up without tech stocks help. In fact, SPY is actually lower than it should be because tech stocks (all those FANGS and M and Tesla and yadda you know who)... are down. when has it ever been like this?\n\nüì∑\n\nSpy 400\n\n**SO WHAT I THINK SMART $ is doing:**\n\nStimmy money is out, quad witching is over, those that gambled right away got their hands cut on those short trades (as MM wanted to ). That is what MM wanted. They wanted to create an artificial dip, to create a sense of unease, the tension between the bulls and bears. they wanted to take that delicious money out of weak and dumb hands.\n\nThat part is complete, no froth anymore. OK so now what....\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The ROARING 20's all over again! but for all countries!!**\n\nthe vaccine is here, stimmy is out (prob spent), biz getting that PPP, worldwide economies (countries are fighting on who comes out on top). people going!....\n\nüì∑\n\nYou think the US is not going to print $ and not QE and not distribute 4th round PPP or anything they can to ensure economic growth?!\n\nCountries are fighting who gets up and out the fastest.\n\nYou see it is that it's THE WORLD. the countries against who can do best! At no other time has all of the countries been trying to get back asap to one-up each other (since WW2) has there ever been something like this...\n\nThat is why we are going to go sky high with everything in the coming weeks.\n\nüì∑\n\nOld sport showing us how it went down in the 20's\n\nSPY is going to 400 in the coming days. We are going to pulling up to the level we have never seen before.\n\nAnd MM CNBC and every smart money will be telling you don't buy, dollar cost in, remember its frothy, remember we are still in recession, covid, etc....\n\nThey are going to tell you, buy silver ( MM trying to rug pull GME), buy commodities...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBUT they are all in... CATHIE WOOD is all in. don't you think she knows this? like who more smooth brain than cathie??? she outsmarted all those hedge funds and smart money by seeking out 5-10 years ahead. and guess what...\n\nThey know she is ahead. and that's why she's chastizcedd. that's why they crucify her now. but guess what. they just stole her playbook. and the money they will make is your money.\n\n**TLDR**\n\n**AND so to summarize and recap**\n\n**BUY everything you can on the most high spec stock. buy SPY 400's a week out. buy TSLA like its hertz as it declared bankruptcy. because you know where we are? we are in march 2020 (kind of not really as I described above). we are going at least 1/3rd up that we are going to be roaring this year like no other.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**EDIT 1:** I added a few pictures to illustrate my findings. Thank you for the suggestion.\n\nAlso: **even Church religious groups are buying high spec/risk on stocks. GME TSLA.**\n\n**Profit=prophet.    They aren't even going to the moon. They're  going somewhere out ofthis dimension**\n\n[https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/mormon-church-fund-sells-big-tech-buys-tesla-gamestop-stock-2021-3-1030242012](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/mormon-church-fund-sells-big-tech-buys-tesla-gamestop-stock-2021-3-1030242012)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT 2: I have now made this a MEME since it borders sattire\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTHIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE.

I only have a small position in this, 1 share, since it's expensive ($356) but wanted to share it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[$CP stock price during the last year](https://preview.redd.it/9g1ctqgii2p61.png?width=696&format=png&auto=webp&s=790ec91b26fadcef8e96241f25712b39fc1318a6)\n\nBullish points: \n\n* Entered a merger agreement with Kansas City Southern (another railway) to purchase them for US$29 billion. This will be the first direct railway that connects the US, Canada, and Mexico. Canadian Pacific Railway stock dipped from $385.87 to around $353 on this news they were purchasing the Kansas City Southern railway. I think this is a good buy-in opportunity as I think it'll recover slowly in the next few weeks or so.\n* In the last 1 year, it has gone from $206.82 to $356.10 and in the last 6 months, it has gone from $300.39 to $356.10 (it was $385.87 at its all time high before dipping on the KCS railway purchase). Doesn't necessarily mean that it'll be the same in the future but generally, it has been a bullish stock during the COVID-19 pandemic and will probably continue to grow as the pandemic is over\n*  According to wsj ([https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/CP/research-ratings](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/CP/research-ratings)), it has bullish price targets. High price target is $591, median price target is $495, and low price target is $460 **(currently $356).**  \n* Quarterly net income gained 20.7% in Q4 2020 compared to the same period Q4 2019, and also set an all-time record\n* Their board recently approved a five-for-one split of their shares on Jan. 27, 2021. They will seek shareholder approval at its annual meeting on April 21st and I imagine that they'll probably win with the majority of shareholders approving. While stock splits don't change the fundamental price/values of a company, it definitely makes it more accessible for people to purchase the stock (if they don't have fractional shares on their platform) and even if they had an option to get fractional shares, the psychological effect of seeing a stock at a lower price will be more encouraging to some. \n* This is just a personal prediction of mine but imo, I do think that trade will start to increase as COVID-19 starts to go away and that there'll be less trade disputes over what Canada's importing/exporting to the US. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f4vn32goi2p61.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1ef57a9a082e1b0a24a8424cc59cea2ec5e7341d\n\nBearish Points:\n\n* The Kansas City Southern merger deal is great for $CP in the long run but what if the Canadian or American governments decide to cancel the merger due to some antitrust laws or something? I don't think it'll happen because there are other major railways in the US/Canada and this merger doesn't make Canadian Pacific Railway a monopoly/even close to a monopoly in terms of railways. Apprantley, CP has tried to merge with other railways in the past and wasn't given permission by regulators to do so. There is a chance that this might happen again so take it into consideration\n* Yearly income was the same in 2019 and 2020 - around $2.44 billion Canadian dollars (though you could argue that during COVID-19, they faced some challenges initially at the start of the pandemic). \n* Current unstable market conditions and general bearish sentiment (I'm a bull though) currently could decrease the price of the stock. However, it's honestly been holding up pretty nicely in the month of March, where a lot of stocks have decreased or hasn't moved that much up. Except, until they bought the Kansas City Southern railway, where they dropped about $27 from their all time high. Other than that, was going up/stable up to that point during this month.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat's all for my general DD on $CP, not a extremely exciting stock, can even call it a boomer stock to be honest but it's been going up pretty nicely in the last year or so, so I wanted to share it with the rest of y'all.","created_utc":"2021-03-24 20:22:51","num_comments":5,"score":16,"upvote_ratio":0.77,"is_original_content":false,"permalink":"/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mcl3di/bullish_dd_on_canadian_pacific_railway_cp_some/","title":"Bullish DD on Canadian Pacific Railway ($CP) - some bearish points too","author":"SweetReptile","firstseen":"2021-03-25 04:10:00.008364"}

{"_id":{"$oid":"605c0d18bbde302a0c6d3e91"},"id":"mckt2y","fullname":"t3_mckt2y","selftext":"After a best-in-class data readout in Phase 1 studies for the treatment of PNH, BCX9930 will begin Phase 3 is set to begin Phase 3 pivotal trials in 2H‚Äô21. BioCryst Pharmaceuticals is developing BCX9930 as an oral monotherapy against an array of rare complement-mediated diseases. BCX9930 is targeting Factor D inhibition in the Alternative pathway of the complement cascade and the Company has currently announced eight rare disease indications that 9930 can target.\n\nSo, what is PNH? Patients suffer from PNH due to defective bone marrow functionality that results in the production of abnormal red blood cells (RBC) with compromised structural integrity. This deficient structural integrity occurs due to an acquired somatic mutation of the PIG-A gene, which is necessary for GPI-anchored proteins to latch onto the cellular membranes of RBCs and protect them from the immune system. Due to their lack of GPI-anchored proteins, the complement system begins to attack PNH RBCs and causes them to rupture.\n\nNow, what is the complement system? The complement system consists of over 30 proteins and protein fragments and serves as a bridge between the innate and adaptive immune systems by enhancing the lethal effect of antibodies and phagocytic cells when fighting bacteria, viruses or other foreign substances in the body. An abnormally activated complement system essentially amplifies inflammation and attracts an exponentially increasing volume of phagocytic cells that destroy the patient‚Äôs healthy cells. PNH patients and patients suffering from other complement-mediated diseases all experience this complement dysregulation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qhoftw5be2p61.png?width=468&format=png&auto=webp&s=15291cdc4e5c65c0a300d4033517b502e40942b1\n\nAs you can see in this chart above, healthy RBCs express a terminal complement inhibitor protein that protects the RBC from your complement system and these RBCs typically live for 90-120 days. However, patients with PNH have RBCs that only live anywhere between 8-40 days due to them undergoing hemolysis and prematurely being killed off by the complement system. The worst part is that patients with PNH develop compromised bone marrow function over time (your bone marrow is responsible for generating new RBCs) and the bone marrow of these PNH patients continuously begin to churn out RBCs with terminal complement inhibitor deficiency, which results in an exponentially increasing rate of hemolysis over time as a greater proportion of your RBCs become PNH RBCs.\n\nSo, how do we mitigate or stop hemolysis? We‚Äôve got two options. The first is to develop some sort of complement protein inhibitor that will help mitigate hemolysis. The other is to supply patients with fresh volumes of healthy RBCs via transfusions.\n\nLet‚Äôs start by looking at the landscape of complement protein inhibitors that PNH patients currently can choose from‚Ä¶ which they unfortunately currently have no choices to pick between. The historical standard of care for PNH has been a suite of C5 inhibitors called Soliris (eculizumab) and Ultomiris (ravulizumab), which were both developed by Alexion Pharmaceuticals. Ultomiris was the second-generation iteration of Soliris and unfortunately, both of these complement inhibitors that target the C5 protein have provided little relief to PNH patients but Alexion was able to dominate the market due to a lack of therapeutic options the past 14 years. The treatment regimen for patients on these C5 inhibitors has been uncomfortable to say the least because Soliris and Ultomiris are injectables that are given intravenously every two weeks and eight weeks, respectively. Soliris also requires patients to get a meningococcal vaccine two weeks prior to usage and unfortunately, the efficacy of Ultomiris is ‚Äúnon-inferior‚Äù to Soliris. To make matters worse, RBCs in PNH patients have begun to develop C5 protein mutations that make them resistant to the binding of Soliris and Ultomiris.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bd2px8fce2p61.png?width=468&format=png&auto=webp&s=102aa87b82f2618baa2ca4efe7758fafed17883f\n\nWhat makes C5 inhibitors a weak therapeutic strategy to tackle PNH is that C5 inhibitors are only able to tackle intravascular hemolysis and cannot protect patients from extravascular hemolysis. Furthermore, C5 inhibitors target the Terminal Complement Pathway, which is everything that occurs after ‚ÄúC5 convertase‚Äù in the graphic above. This means that everything prior to this is still ongoing in the background in the bodies of PNH patients, which is extremely dangerous. If you make this even more basic by looking at what % of the total complement regulatory pathway C5 inhibitors mitigate, it‚Äôs fair to say that they target only around 33% of the end-to-end process.\n\nNow, this is where BCX9930 offers a revolutionary value proposition due to its targeting of the Factor D protein in the Alternative Pathway of complement regulation. I‚Äôve tried to keep it simple thus far but I‚Äôm going to have to get a little technical here so bear with me. The primary function of C3 convertase is to cleave or ‚Äúconvert‚Äù C3 complement proteins into C3 and C3b, with C3b then floating off to join C2b and C4b proteins to form C5 convertase, which then continues triggering the rest of the process that inevitably results in the formation of the MAC protein complex that leads to hemolysis. Factor D inhibition via the Alternative Pathway targets C3 activity that occurs near the beginning of the complement regulatory pathway, which you can see in the graphic above. This essentially means that BCX9930 is targeting mitigating the entire end-to-end process, rather than just 33% or the last portion of the complement regulatory pathway like C5 inhibitors do.\n\nUsually, C3 convertase is responsible for cleaving C3 proteins, but the interesting thing is that even when not in the presence of an enzyme like C3 convertase, C3 can still independently split into C3a and C3b on its own at a very slow rate. When the complement system is triggered via the Alternative pathway, Factor B binds to C3b proteins that are opsonizing the pathogen. Opsonization is something that I will explain more deeply later but it essentially means that C3b  serve as police sirens that alert the body‚Äôs immune system to come and check out this ‚Äúforeign body‚Äù, which are the RBCs in the case of PNH patients. After Factor B binds to C3b that is opsonizing the RBC, Factor D is now able to cleave Factor B into Ba and Bb. Although Ba floats off, Bb stays integrated with C3b to form a complex that cleaves C3 protein just like C3 convertase. The Alternative pathway now follows the same cascade that occurs in the Classic and Lectin pathways after C3 is cleaved. Therefore, an amplification loop is created since C3 can spontaneously cleave and propagate a flurry of complement activity that proves to be exponentially destructive if done in parallel with Classical or Lectin pathway cascades that are already activated.\n\nNow, why is the Alternative Pathway better than the Classical or Lectin Pathways of complement mediation? It‚Äôs because both the Classical and Lectin Pathways are receptor-based. The Classical Pathway requires antigen-antibody complexes, while the Lectin Pathway requires Mannose on the cell membrane. Meanwhile, the Alternative Pathway simply takes advantage of already naturally occurring slow cleavage in C3 that we discussed above and the Factor D protein is the key that ignites overdrive. Therefore, there is no quid pro quo or receptor to activate the Alternative Pathway nor the Factor D inhibition mechanism! If we shut Factor D off, cleavage gets mitigated to reduce all resulting damage from immune over-response. Remember, we are also shutting off the immune-overreaction engine MUCH sooner in the complement pathway by targeting Factor D, while C5 inhibitors target the terminal pathway or tail-end of the complement pathway which leaves patients suffering from all the damage caused by preceding complement activity. Furthermore, Factor D inhibition and targeting of the Alternative Pathway results in mitigation of both extravascular AND intravascular hemolysis. I‚Äôll post all three pathways below to help you visualize what I‚Äôm explaining above.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xew2xmkde2p61.png?width=468&format=png&auto=webp&s=dce708bf687a55df9e47d55c0e7c9e72bc39e0ae\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/iittbv6ee2p61.png?width=468&format=png&auto=webp&s=5ed4f9b2727aa939ce242316872f06278f0e2052\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9uifi6uee2p61.png?width=468&format=png&auto=webp&s=a0a7aefdb4150722d1e9c306f0c09ed49eda69cf\n\nThese slides are in an investment thesis deck that I made and posted a month or so ago, which will be updated and reposted in the coming days with all the phenomenal data we received at R&D Day. Anyways, I hope you can now see why Factor D inhibition in the Alternative Pathway is the most potent way to treat PNH and other complement-mediated diseases! Once again, as a reminder, it capitalizes on targeting C3b which naturally forms after C3 organically cleaves over time without the need for an enzyme like C3 convertase or receptors like immune complexes or Mannose.\n\nLet‚Äôs take a step back to Soliris (eculizumab) for a second because R&D Day provided a fantastic array of physician insight around why C5 inhibitors will no longer be the standard of care once 9930 commercializes. Austin Kulasekararaj, a Consultant MD of Hematology to BioCryst, explained how a significant number of PNH patients on C5 inhibitors continue to remain anemic due to the lack of extravascular hemolysis mitigation, which causes a large proportion of these patients to suffer from the consequences of anemia. Soliris patients also need significant blood transfusions at regular intervals. Furthermore, from a patient quality of life standpoint, having biweekly infusions and countless blood transfusions for decades on end is not a comfortable treatment regimen.\n\n**Now, moving on to analyzing the complete Phase 1 data readout we received for BCX9930:**\n\nFirst, let‚Äôs set the stage. BCX9930 was studied in both treatment-na√Øve patients (those who have never been treated with C5 inhibitors before) and C5 inhibitor (Soliris) patients who were given 9930 in addition to their current regimen of Soliris. Sixteen patients, ten treatment-na√Øve and six who had an inadequate response on a C5 inhibitor, received BCX9930 at doses of 400 mg bid or 500 mg bid for at least eight weeks. Treatment with BCX9930 at doses of 400 mg bid or 500 mg bid for at least eight weeks resulted in significant improvements in clinical symptoms and laboratory biomarkers of disease in both the treatment-na√Øve and C5 inadequate-responder cohorts. It is important to note that all C5 inhibitor patients had an inadequate response to Soliris and were severely ill with persistent anemia and transfusion dependency. This is crucial because it only highlights how much more impressive our 9930 data was, since patients with severely compromised systems were still able to reap immense benefits from our oral monotherapy. ***Furthermore, we will be initiating Phase 3 pivotal trials in PNH because of how industry-redefining BCX9930 was during Phase 1 studies. This is HUGE. We can essentially file for approval right after we finish the pivotal trial and let‚Äôs not forget that BCX9930 has Fast Track and Orphan Drug designations as well, which will only expedite our go-to-market process.*** Now, let‚Äôs highlight the key data nukes we got from the complete BCX9930 Phase 1 readout:\n\n1. **100% Transfusion-free for C5-inhibitor Na√Øve Subjects on 400mg or 500mg BID**WOW. This is revolutionary. In fact, it‚Äôs never been achieved before. Never before have PNH patients of any treatment profile been able to completely be free of transfusions or have 0 transfusion dependency. Treatment-na√Øve patients being able to sustain themselves with 0 transfusions is nothing short of a medical breakthrough. Prior to being given BCX9930, 78% percent of treatment-na√Øve patients required transfusions.\n2. **83% Transfusion-free for C5-inhibitor Inadequate Response Subjects**This is phenomenal. Let it really sink in‚Ä¶ 83% of Soliris-nonresponding patients no longer needed the transfusions that they so desperately needed prior to 9930 being infused into their treatment regimen. Prior to being given BCX9930, 83% of these patients required transfusions or only 17% were transfusion-free. In fact, I think our 83% transfusion-free number will be even higher in the Phase 3 pivotal trials because this Phase 1 study in Soliris patients only had 6 patients in the cohort. It is also important to note that the patient who required the transfusion (Patient B) was severely ill and actually needed a higher dosage than his peer counterparts. His condition was so severe that he actually underwent 13 units of RBC transfusions in just the 12 months prior to beginning treatment. That‚Äôs why the 50mg bid was not sufficient in the beginning and he needed a 2-unit RBC transfusion just two weeks after beginning the 50mg bid. Physicians adjusted his dosing to the 400mg at Week 20 and 500mg at Week 28 and all the symptoms disappeared. In fact, his hemoglobin nearly doubled by the end of the 50 weeks from 6.7 g/dL to 13.8 g/dL and his LDH fell from 10.6 x ULN to 1.4 x ULN at Week 50. RBC clone size also gapped up from 41.9% to 99.7%, which is amazing in such a bone-marrow compromised patient. Once again, it‚Äôs important to note that BCX9930 performed extremely well by generating a 83% transfusion-free rate in 6 severely ill patients who had health complications ranging from bone marrow failure (3 patients), thrombosis aka blood clots (3 patients), and an average of baseline transfusion-free rate of only 17%. I also truly believe that if we were to do the Phase 3 pivotals on the 500mg bid, every single patient will be transfusion free in both the treatment-na√Øve and Soliris patient cohorts and all biomarkers would be even better than they already are in this Phase 1 readout.\n3. **BCX9930 drove substantial improvements of hemoglobin levels in both treatment-na√Øve and in C5 inhibitor inadequate response patients.**  \nHemoglobin levels increased by a mean of 3.5 g/dL in treatment-na√Øve patients and 3.2 g/dL in C5 inhibitor inadequate response patients that resulted in mean hemoglobin levels of 11.8 g/dL and 12.2 g/dL, respectively. Amazing.\n4. **Relative red blood cell clone size, a marker of hemolytic control, also increased from 53 to 92 percent in treatment-na√Øve patients and from 50 to 80 percent in C5 inhibitor inadequate response patients**Nothing much to be said here. Fantastic.\n5. **BCX9930 demonstrated robust mitigation of extravascular hemolysis, with RBC C3 Opsonization falling to below 2%**  \nC3 opsonization, which I alluded to earlier in this analysis during the PNH overview, was actually a metric of particular interest to me and as promised, I will dive deeper and explain its significance. As I briefly explained prior, opsonization is basically the process of complement proteins attaching to material they deem as ‚Äúforeign‚Äù and making it easier for the body‚Äôs immune system to grip and eliminate this ‚Äúforeign‚Äù body. In the complement system, C3 proteins are a primary agent of opsonizations. As you can probably surmise, a high rate of opsonization helps the already overactive immune system in eliminating RBCs in PNH patients and creates an amplification loop of cellular destruction. Now, BCX9930 actually REDUCED this opsonization to less than 2% in just 8 weeks which is mind-blowing because the overactive complement system‚Äôs destruction is mitigated due to them not being able to destroy RBCs at the same frequency as they could before, which in turn leads to lower rates of hemolysis. Remember! Soliris and Ultomiris cannot control extravascular hemolysis at all, so BCX9930 already stands out on just this aspect alone without accounting for the other metrics it beats C5 inhibitors on.\n6. **BCX9930 demonstrated robust mitigation of intravascular hemolysis**In C5 inhibitor na√Øve patients, clinical chemistry biomarkers of intravascular hemolysis, including lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and bilirubin, all declined. Mean LDH x ULN declined by 73 percent from 7.5x ULN at baseline to 2.0x ULN. These biomarkers were major improvements in the patients studied but for some reason, we have seen a lot of doubters promoting higher expectations for LDH reduction as a reason to discount the industry-redefining therapeutic efficacy that BCX9930 offers to PNH patients. It‚Äôs important to remember that LDH is nothing but a measure of RESIDUAL hemolysis at any given time. This is a crucial note to keep in mind when assessing the data of the Soliris patients because as we all now know, Soliris has way less efficacy than BCX9930 does and the transfusion rate was MUCH higher. This means that hemolysis in Soliris patients occurred at much higher degrees and a lot of residual hemolysis got baked into the readout due to the preexisting hemolysis not being fully flushed out during the study time of BCX9930 as its value began taking effect in reducing hemolysis. In addition, since LDH is derived from red blood cells, the more blood a person has, the more LDH they have. ***What people who tunnel vision on LDH are also conveniently ignoring is that when it comes to PNH, the most important improvements that need to occur are in hemoglobin and transfusion rates. This statement is not just my opinion, it‚Äôs also the opinion of physicians and experts in the field who are on the frontlines combatting PNH.*** My bet? That our LDH values will only get better over time as our patients that remain on BCX9930 transition to pivotals. As I mentioned before, I also strongly believe that all biomarkers and even the transfusion-free rates in Soliris patients will actually get better if the Phase 3 pivotal trials were to be conducted on the 500mg bid due to it showing a fantastic safety profile and the highest degree of efficacy. Our 83% transfusion-free rate in Soliris-resistant patients is great to begin with but I really see it getting to above 90% in the Phase 3 pivotals if the 500mg bid is chosen. In addition, remember that the reason that it was 83% in the first place was because that one patient was started on a very low dose of BCX9930, but when the dose was increased, their response became complete. In other words, whether the patients respond to Soliris or not, they respond 100% to BCX9930. Amazing!\n7. **RBC C3 Opsonization Showed a Pattern of Early Response in 5 of 6 Soliris Patients** and **Hemoglobin also Responded Within Weeks**Not only did we deliver fantastic patient outcomes at the end of the study but BCX9930 began driving value for patients VERY early on after they began treatment. This is very important and furthermore, as the data showed over the year-long study ‚Äì our medication was DURABLE and its efficacy improved over time and drove better health outcomes for patients the longer they were on BCX9930. Competitors like Apellis Pharma‚Äôs pegcetacoplan cannot say the same. Their hemoglobin efficacy actually decreased over time and there were a flurry of other biomarker activity that makes them inferior, which I have documented in a prior post that you can find on my profile.\n\n**Summarized Phase 1 Patient Outcomes from treatment on 400mg or 500mg of BCX9930:**\n\n* Hemoglobin increased across the board, with relief of anemia and consistent outcomes in both C5-inhibitor na√Øve and C5-inhibitor inadequate response.\n* Transfusions were completely avoided (pending the 1 C5 patient with severe preexisting conditions that we discussed, which was later resolved and they did not require transfusions as well).\n* Intravascular and extravascular hemolysis were brought under control.\n* No safety signals were seenin routine monitoring of adverse events, vital signs, ECGs, or laboratory evaluations of hematology, clinical chemistry, coagulation, or urinalysis.\n* No serious adverse events (SAEs) with only two mild side effects being a fleeting headache for 1-3 days after beginning treatment and a mild rash that resolved in just 10 days.\n* No discontinuations or interruptions of dosing due to BCX9930-related treatment-emergent AEs occurred.\n\n**Now let‚Äôs talk about the market research that was conducted by BioCryst and key takeaways from the Discussion Panel of key opinion leaders, physicians, and real-time PNH patients:**\n\n**Market Research** ‚Äì A total of 25 physicians and 23 PNH patients were surveyed with 60-minute double-blinded qualitative tele-depth interviews.\n\n* The average hemoglobin level in these 23 patients who were all either on Soliris or Ultomiris was around 9.3 g/dL. Noting this because our studies helped our C5 inhibitor patients get to mean hemoglobin levels much higher than this.\n* A good portion of patients are actually currently satisfied on Soliris and Ultomiris but it‚Äôs important to note that this is because they have no other alternative to dealing with their debilitating disease and these C5 inhibitors make their condition somewhat manageable.\n* Even though Soliris/Ultomiris patients are understandably grateful for their therapeutic, nearly 91% of these C5 inhibitor patients described a need for greater efficacy and reduced treatment burden. These same patients asserted that an oral treatment option, plus potential improved hemoglobin and symptom control, would drive a massive desire to switch. It is also important to note that the patients‚Äô desire to switch to an oral factor D inhibitor was not correlated to satisfaction with current treatment.\n\n**Physician Insight:**\n\n* Dr. Austin Kulasekararaj, Consultant MD of Hematology, believes that patients will no longer be interested in an intravenous biweekly C5 inhibitor once they find out that there is an oral complement inhibitor that demonstrates higher hemoglobin rates and little to no transfusion dependency.\n* Dr. Brad Rovin, who was involved in trials for Aurinia Pharmaceutical‚Äôs Voclosporin as a treatment for Lupus nephritis, was super excited and seemed to favor the potential of BCX9930. Dr. Rovin believes that blocking Factor D is really the target that should be pursued because having a factor D complement inhibitor that takes out both the membrane attack complex down the line as well as the anaphylactic toxins that cause inflammation in the complement pathway prior like C5a ‚Ä¶ this could really be a benefit in treating and managing rare kidney diseases.\n\n**Real-time PNH Patient Insight:**\n\n* Barry Katsof, Founder and President of the PNH Patient‚Äôs Association of Canada and Founder of the PNH Global Alliance, suffers from PNH himself and had the following to say about why the lives of PNH patients revolve around transfusions: *‚ÄúTransfusions in and in themselves are very problematic. You just don‚Äôt go into a blood bank and say give me two units of Type A. It doesn‚Äôt work that way. You get your blood tests, then your doctor determines that you need a top up if you want to call it that, then you have to go back for a cross match. Then after lots of transfusions, you end up building up antibodies and they have to get you a proper blood to match what you have or what the patient has. All and told, besides feeling very sluggish and not well before you need the transfusion with hemoglobin in the 70s, it could take several days until you actually get the transfusion. Then once you get the transfusion, you just don‚Äôt walk out of the clinic and feel 100%, it takes another couple of days until your body adapts to the transfusion.  So again, it‚Äôs very time consuming and plays upon patient‚Äôs lifestyle, the sequence everything depends upon when you‚Äôre going to need a transfusion. If you‚Äôre working, you have to take time off‚Ä¶it becomes very burdensome on the patient and their lifestyle by being tied to an infusion schedule of every few weeks, or every few months. Again, you have to run your life and manage your life around your infusion schedules and your transfusion schedules. Far from optimal. Granted, it‚Äôs eliminating some of the uglier aspects of PNH. But it is still not an optimal lifestyle.* ***So, having the option of a treatment that will allow the patient to have an acceptable hemoglobin and reduce or eliminate the need for transfusions, as they say, in the advertisements‚Ä¶ is priceless.***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Patient A was on C5 inhibitors and transfusion-dependent. These are their thoughts:**\n   * *‚ÄúI still have issues, but I can lead a life‚Ä¶ I have a life‚Ä¶that I‚Äôm okay with, it‚Äôs not what it was‚Ä¶but until something else comes along‚Ä¶right now that‚Äôs what I‚Äôve got‚Äù*\n   * *‚ÄúWell, the back pain has improved, every now and then I‚Äôll get walloped. It lasts for about 15 -20 minutes‚Ä¶ It hurts like crazy, it‚Äôs pretty unbearable, but I know its gonna pass so I just have to bite my lip if you will, and just knuckle under and get through it.‚Äù*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Patient B was C5 inhibitors and transfusion-free. These are their thoughts:**\n   * *‚ÄúI‚Äôd love to have my blood counts be a little higher. Absolutely‚Ä¶ If that could incrementally improve I‚Äôd like that. I don‚Äôt really notice fatigue that often, but if I could be less fatigued and have more energy I would take that all day too.‚Äù*\n   * *‚ÄúI wish I didn‚Äôt have to do it, it didn‚Äôt take so long to administer. What I would like to see in the future is something I could do daily or‚Ä¶I‚Äôd rather take a pill daily than go every 8 weeks to get an infusion because I would just take it with my vitamin. I get there at 8 o‚Äôclock, and just the process of getting set up, and getting stuck, and then mixing the drug, having the right blood work done, getting the results back and then getting it. That‚Äôs cumbersome‚Ä¶that takes forever‚Ä¶I wish it wasn‚Äôt that long. I wish it was a little bit easier than that but it‚Äôs not.‚Äù*\n   * *‚ÄúHonestly, that‚Äôs exactly the kind of thing I‚Äôd be looking for is something like this. This would be my ‚Äòpie-in-the-sky‚Äô dream scenario; taking a pill twice a day rather than going and getting any kind of sticks and infusions. I would much rather do this especially if it improves my quality of life which is paramount to me‚Ä¶so all that stuff. This would be my dream scenario is what we are describing right here. I would switch in a heartbeat‚Ä¶I could take something orally like a pill every day? I‚Äôd be in so quick.‚Äù*\n\n**Final takeaways from BioCryst‚Äôs first R&D Day:**\n\n1. BCX9930 will become the standard of care for treatment of PNH, for treatment-na√Øve, legacy C5 inhibitor patients on Soliris/Ultomiris, and those resistant to Soliris/Ultomiris. **The fact that we were able to drive a 100% transfusion-free rate in treatment-na√Øve patients means that physicians will be prescribing BCX9930 to every new patient that develops PNH and requires therapy for it, so I believe that BCX99930 will monopolize the market of new patients. Furthermore,  I believe that BCX9930 will begin siphoning away nearly all current C5 inhibitor patients due to the fact that we will be an oral monotherapy and our hemoglobin and transfusion rates are much more attractive.** Unfortunately, C5 inhibitors have been the only treatment option for PNH patients for the last 14 years and unfortunately, they target relieving thrombosis (blood clots) so patients continue to remain anemic and transfusion-dependent. On the other hand, BCX9930 targets transfusion independency in addition to every other major health complication that PNH patients experience by inhibiting complement activity much earlier on by targeting the Factor D protein in the complement cascade. Remember the graphic I showed in the very beginning, C5 inhibitors leave much of the complement pathway and their accompanying health complications unaddressed due to Soliris/Ultomiris targeting the latter portion of the cascade.\n2. Real-time patient Barry Katsof‚Äôs final words on what he thought of BCX9930‚Äôs results: *‚ÄúFreedom. Freedom from needing transfusions, freedom to be able to go out and do the things I like to do‚Ä¶ cycle, hike in the woods‚Ä¶. that‚Äôs because my hemoglobin levels will be at an acceptable level to allow me to do that. I won‚Äôt need transfusions. I won‚Äôt have to worry about the iron overload. I won‚Äôt have to hedge or manage my travel schedules about when I need infusions in the clinic, and so on.* ***So, these numbers are from a patient‚Äôs point of view‚Ä¶ VERY, VERY encouraging. It gives the quality of life back to the patients that we‚Äôve lost for so many years.‚Äù***\n3. Patient B was a rare case of being transfusion-free on C5 inhibitors and was fairly content with Ultomiris but he still openly expressed an eager desire to switch to an oral therapy like BCX9930 due to its stronger efficacy, better quality of life, and more convenient treatment regimen. This substantiates my hypothesis that BCX9930 will siphon heavy marketshare from Alexion/AstraZeneca and their C5 inhibitors upon commercialization.\n4. The clock is ticking for C5 inhibitors and they will become obsolete, especially if Phase 3 pivotal trials are as blockbuster as I expect them to be. We have no real competition on the market, both in development nor currently on the market. Apellis Pharma‚Äôs pegcetacoplan is a C3 inhibitor that is up for a PDUFA decision soon but their drug is not durable and offers a weaker therapeutic value proposition for a number of reasons that I have outlined in a prior post that you can find on my profile. Novartis and their Factor B inhibitor are a non-issue as well for a number of reasons, with the primary being they have not included severely ill patients with compromised bone marrow function in their studies and are trying to bring a combo therapy with Soliris to market versus our oral monotherapy. Our ability to help patients stay transfusion free, all while organically maintaining a degree of hemoglobin improvement that is best-in-class will be very hard to go toe-to-toe with. I also personally think Factor D inhibition is a more potent treatment regimen that will drive higher value for patients versus Factor B because Factor D is what is necessary to cleave Factor B and get the Alternative Pathway rolling. ALXN 2050 is probably the only molecule of interest to me but their trials are moving at a snail‚Äôs pace, and the FDA seems to be worried about renal or heart issues hence they are being tested in additional Phase 1 safety trials first. I have an entire PNH market map slide in my investment thesis that maps out all the competition, which you can also find on my profile.\n5. As I proposed extensively above, **a higher dosage like the 500mg bid will amplify the already phenomenal results that BCX9930 displayed. I think the transfusion-free rate for C5 inhibitor patients will be able to cross the 90% threshold and hemoglobin improvements will only further increase. Other key biomarkers will also strengthen and only solidify as the new standard of care.** This data nuke couldn‚Äôt have been stronger, I am very pleased with the data readout and am looking forward to Phase 3 pivotal trials beginning in 2H‚Äô21. Remember ‚Äì once Phase 3 pivotals are done (which I think will be done quickly relative to industry norms due to our Fast Track and Orphan Drug designations) and the fact that patients respond to the drug very quickly, we go straight to applying for marketing authorization!\n6. As per Management, proof-of-concept trials for renal indications will also begin in 2H‚Äô21. I‚Äôm especially excited to see if we begin trials for Lupus nephritis because Dr. Rovin seemed like a staunch supporter of ours and I think we could also drive value on the safety front for patients at the bare minimum. I view Voclosporin the same as Soliris/Ultomiris ‚Äì some relief but not optimal. If I‚Äôm not mistaken, Voclosporin only has around 40% efficacy and some serious SAEs that could potentially inhibit it as a combo therapy. A better-case scenario would be we drive value on both the efficacy and safety as a combo therapy. However, the best case scenario would be disrupting Voclosporin completely by beating it on both efficacy and safety as an oral monotherapy! Excited to see how things play out on the renal front with BCX9930.\n\nRemember! PNH is just 1 of 8 currently announced complement-mediated rare disease that BCX9930 can target. BCX9930 is going to be an assassin that takes out countless burgeoning biotechs and multiple big pharma giants. I see a very bright future full of limitless potential for this pipeline in a molecule. Oh yes, and let‚Äôs not forget about BioCryst‚Äôs first blockbuster cash cow called Orladeyo that will be serving HAE patients worldwide this year and the other innovative oral therapeutics in the pipeline that the Company is working hard to develop.\n\n\\-ThirdEyeHoldings\n\nAs always, none of my posts are financial advice.

{"_id":{"$oid":"605c0d18bbde302a0c6d3e94"},"id":"mckprn","fullname":"t3_mckprn","selftext":"On Monday, Biocryst announced the results of its BCX9930 treatment in 16 severe PNH patients, 10 of whom were treatment-na√Øve and 6 who were resistant to the standard of care, Alexion‚Äôs Eculizumab. The patients were on the drug, which is **oral** as compared to weekly injections of Eculizumab, for a median of over 5 months. Better even than I‚Äôd hoped for ([https://www.reddit.com/r/BCRX/comments/lmyrvj/what\\_bio99bio9999\\_is\\_looking\\_for\\_in\\_bcrxs\\_next/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/BCRX/comments/lmyrvj/what_bio99bio9999_is_looking_for_in_bcrxs_next/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)), the treatment-na√Øve cohort of PNH patients had zero need for transfusions over the entire time period. Remember, PNH is characterized by frequent dangerous drops in hemoglobin requiring regular blood transfusions. Only one out of the six Eculizumab-resistant patients given BCX9930 needed transfusions (but only when they were still at an early very low dose). Relatedly, hemoglobin levels jumped to the normal range, with a difference of 3.2 g/dL in Eculizumab-resistant patients and 3.5 g/dL in treatment-naive patients. Unprecedented indeed! See my prior analysis of this vs. Alexion‚Äôs Factor D drug here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/BCRX/comments/lj6bzx/first\\_look\\_at\\_alexions\\_factor\\_d\\_drugs\\_relative\\_to/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/BCRX/comments/lj6bzx/first_look_at_alexions_factor_d_drugs_relative_to/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\nNot surprisingly, the FDA and European health agency (EMA) are excited and the company reported that with their support it will initiate a pivotal trial in the second half of the year (). What is a pivotal trial? It‚Äôs a clinical trial that places the drug of interest randomized head-to-head against the standard of care, in this case Eculizumab, to determine whether it is better and with less severe side-effects, and in a way that achieves statistical significance. Why is this so important? Because low hemoglobin with its severe side-effects and the lack of a need for regular blood transfusions with their corresponding risks are the benchmarks that this trial will be based on, BCX9930 will win hands down. Not only does hemoglobin rise very quickly to normal levels in all BCX9930 patients treated so far, their side-effects are minimal, e.g., headache and mild self-resolving rashes. Compare this to Eculizumab and its weekly injections and its severe side-effects. Here is a typical patient on Eculizumab as an example, a lady who was ‚Äúsuccessfully treated‚Äù during her two pregnancies and still requiring multiple blood transfusions ([https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33665137/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33665137/)). Keep in mind that Eculizumab resistance, aka drug failure, is very common and we would see this instantly in a randomized trial format. Eculizumab is not able to suppress extravascular hemolysis while BCX9930 does so very well.\n\nWhen could this trial yield results? All kinds of dates ranging from 2022 to 2025 are bandied around, and it‚Äôs still hard to know. But I suspect far faster than even the most bullish expectations. Why? Five reasons. 1) The FDA has granted the drug orphan and fast-track status. This means that A) a phase II trial with solid results is enough, especially for a rare disease that Biocryst is already treating a large percentage of the world‚Äôs PNH patients in its phase IB trial. B) everything is open label with data continuously being analyzed and monitored together with the FDA for more rapid action, assessment and approval. C) These complement diseases are devastating, patients are very sick and frequently die from complications, and so there is a level of urgency you rarely see. D) BCX9930 results in rapid changes in blocking hemolysis that are very statistically significant at 8 weeks. In other words, within two months it will become obvious to everyone, as it‚Äôs all open-label too, that the BCX9930 patients don‚Äôt need transfusions while the Eculizumab patients are doing relatively very poorly and a large fraction are resistant and needing transfusions and having severe side-effects or even death. Within 5 months, as with the patients presented on R&D day, it will be painfully obvious, and patients and doctors on the Eculizumab part of the trial will be begging for them to be switched to BCX9930. 5) Patients and their doctors are flocking to BCX9930. Who wouldn‚Äôt? Its phase I trial was 50% oversubscribed and completed 5 months earlier than expected‚Äîin December 2020 instead of May 2021. That means that the FDA, by the time that the interim pivotal trial data is analyzed, will also have been studying the outcomes of a couple hundred patients for up to 18 months in the phase IB trial. So the pivotal trial will hit the ground running with full subscription from the beginning as there is so much pent-up demand for an efficacious and oral drug. And judging from the KOLs speaking on R&D day, doctors are even more thrilled, laughing amusedly when asked if there are other indications for a complement inhibitor, and explaining to listeners that they are hoping that lupus nephropathy and diabetic nephropathy be included quickly too.\n\nThe FDA will therefore have more than enough data to draw the appropriate conclusion that this drug is safe and efficacious and superior to the standard of care within 2-5 months of the start of the pivotal trial and could grant it a PDUFA date very quickly, perhaps issuing the date 6 months after the start date for a date a few months afterwards. Given that the FDA is in talks with Biocryst to expand the trials to other diagnoses, I can guarantee you that they‚Äôre excited. I can also almost guarantee that after the R&D day, Biocryst requested Breakthrough designation for its drug. This is like Fast track status plus. It will speed up the process even more by bringing more FDA managers into harmony. And the EMA will not be far behind in granting it faster approval, as a large percentage of the patients being treated by BCX9930 are in Europe, and it is very sensitive to the severe need. And international harmonization of drug approval will be working in Biocryst‚Äôs favor, particularly because of its focus on rare diseases ([https://www.reddit.com/r/BCRX/comments/lexwaf/international\\_harmonization\\_of\\_drug\\_approvals/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/BCRX/comments/lexwaf/international_harmonization_of_drug_approvals/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)).\n\nWhy else is this important? A pivotal trial means that Biocryst is already far ahead of all of the competition, who are struggling to recruit patients, some of them because they are not oral and others because the results are worse to date or the side-effects worse. I‚Äôm not saying that there are no viable competitors, but Biocryst is ahead now ([https://www.reddit.com/r/BCRX/comments/lgpbxx/question\\_2b\\_biocrysts\\_bcx9930approved\\_sooner\\_than/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/BCRX/comments/lgpbxx/question_2b_biocrysts_bcx9930approved_sooner_than/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)). You can see my analysis of the competitors for four renal indications that Biocryst has stated its interested in pursuing ([https://www.reddit.com/r/BCRX/comments/lu8b5e/bcrxs\\_berotralstat\\_and\\_abdominal\\_aortic\\_aneurysms/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/BCRX/comments/lu8b5e/bcrxs_berotralstat_and_abdominal_aortic_aneurysms/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)). Being ahead matters much more than PNH. There are dozens of diseases that are complement-mediated ([https://www.reddit.com/r/BCRX/comments/laq2pw/question\\_2\\_biocrysts\\_bcx9930is\\_it\\_an/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/BCRX/comments/laq2pw/question_2_biocrysts_bcx9930is_it_an/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)), and the company announced it will be pursuing them rapidly, with at least two renal proof-of-concept trials starting this year too. Just the five diseases I‚Äôve analyzed have potential sales per year of over $40 billion. That is twice as high as the best-selling drug Humira. And with each successful trial, more will be added quickly, and eventually all complement diseases will just be treated off-label. The sheer size of potential sales is unfathomable for a best-in-class oral therapy like this.\n\nWhile the stock went down after the results in the typical sell-the-news day-trading mess that biotech stocks always have on good or bad news days, resulting in it now most certainly becoming the most undervalued stock in the market, analysts were jumping over each other to increase their ridiculously low price targets to slightly higher ones, e.g., HC Wainwright increasing its target today from $14 to 19. Bear in mind when it comes to valuation that Alexion, the company that sells Eculizumab, was acquired for no less than $40 billion, largely for a drug that Biocryst is going to blow out of the water by the end of this year with its interim results, and Biocryst is sitting at a lowly market cap of $2 billion‚Ä¶ Sure, its outperformed the biotech sector and is up over 400% in the past year, but we haven‚Äôt seen nothing yet.

If you don't know this new emerging market i encourage you to check it out. \n\nFrom Benzinga\n-----------\nNFTs Coming:¬†Playboy was attracted to the NFT space given its huge collection of content and the economics of being able to monetize on the initial and each subsequent sale. Kohn told viewers that Playboy has a 68-year-old archive of content that could be valuable in the NFT space.\n\n‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a perfect example of a new revenue stream that has emerged and really leveraged this phenomenal IP we have,‚Äù Kohn said.\n-----------\n\nFrom the earnings call yesterday from Chief Brand Officer, Rachel Webber-\n\"Lastly, we are sitting on almost 70 years of the most incredible and iconic art and photography. We are actively working on our non-fungible tokens or NFT, and digital collectible strategy to enter the space in a thoughtful way, designed for long-term growth and community adoption. We are thrilled by the runway ahead and the wealth of opportunities afforded us by our priceless intellectual property.\"\n\nKohn on fox news stated today that there will be an announcement soon regarding NFTs and it's not just their 68 year old archive that will be utilized. He started throwing out some of the most influential artists of our time that have collaborated with Playboy and are available for NFTs. This is the hottest sector on the market right now and the only sector that is completely ignoring the volitility of the overall market currently. \n\nEven if you're not into emerging markets, their financials are beautiful. Their earnings call yesterday posted 89% growth in revenues year over year. They generated over 1 billion this year in sales on digital commerce platforms in China alone.\n\nTheir magazine is dead, but their brand isn't and I'm bullish on how they are transforming their company.\n\nTLDR: I'm in shares and deep in long options for PLBY because of their involvement in NFTs and overall company transformation.","created_utc":"2021-03-24 19:13:04","num_comments":18,"score":17,"upvote_ratio":0.74,"is_original_content":false,"permalink":"/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mcjkzq/plby_more_than_a_fap_biz/","title":"$PLBY: More Than a Fap Biz","author":"goodspeedmd","firstseen":"2021-03-25 04:10:00.014676"}
